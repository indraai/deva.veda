      "content": "He who with special plans and deathless spirit, waxing, well- born, hath come unto his birth-place, As he who shines upholds the days, thus Trita, of pure life, bears the Three as their supporter.\n\nHe who, the first, approached the holy statutes makes, after, many beauteous forms and figures. Eager to drink, his birth-place first he entered who understands the word when yet unspoken.\n\nHe who—the fluid gold, with radiant kinsmen—to fervent glow delivered up thy body, On him both set names, that shall live for ever: to him the regions shall send robes to clothe him,\n\nAs these have gone to their primeval station, each gaining an imperishable dwelling, May kissing mothers of the bards' beloved bring the pole-draw- ing husband to the sister.\n\nBy holy wisdom I a sage, Far-Strider! offer to thee this lofty adoration. This worship both the mighty eddying rivers, coming together to this station, heighten.\n\nSeven are the pathways which the wise have fashioned: to one of these may come the troubled mortal. On sure ground where the ways are parted standeth Life's Pillar in the dwelling of the Highest.\n\nWorking, I go my way with deathless spirit: life, spirit, bodies have gone gladly thither. Aye, Sakra also gives his gift of treasure as when the sacrificer meets with power.\n\nYea, the son asks dominion of his father: this they declared the noblest path to welfare. Varuna, let them see thy revelations: display the wondrous shapes of times to follow.\n\nHalt with the milk, its other half, thou minglest and with that half, strong! unbeguiled! increasest. Let us exalt the gracious friend, the mighty, Varuna son of- Aditi, strength-giver. We have told him the marvels sung by poets. The utterance of Heaven and Earth is truthful."

As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, when those rejoice in him who bring him succour.\n\nGrown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe strikes fear into the Dāsa, Eager to win the breathing and the breathless: All sang thy praise at banquet and oblation.\n\nAll concentrate on thee their mental vigour what time these, twice or thrice, are thine assistants, Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness win quickly with our meath that meath in battle.\n\nIf verily in every war the sages joy and exult in thee who win- nest treasures, With mightier power, strong God, extend thy firmness: let not malevolent Kaokas harm thee.\n\nProudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great wealth the prize of combat. I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with my prayer thy vital vigour.\n\nThou in that house, the highest or the lowest, which thy protec- tion guards, bestowest riches. Establish ye the ever-wandering mother, and bring full many deeds to their completion.\n\nPraise in the height Him who hath many pathways, courageous, strongest, Aptya of the Aptyas Through strength he shows himself of ample power: pattern of Prithivī, he fights and conquers.\n\nBrihaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, hath made these holy prayers, this strength for Indra. Free Lord, he rules the mighty fold of cattle, winning, aglow, even all the billowy waters.\n\nThus hath Brihaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as himself in person. Two sisters free from stain, the Mātarivans, with power impel him onward and exalt him."

      "content": "These first, the boundless Sea, and Mātarisvan, fierce glowing Fire, the Strong, the Bliss-bestower, And heavenly Floods, first-born by holy Order, exclaimed against the outrage on a Brāhman.\n\nKing Soma first of all, without reluctance, made restitution of the Brāhman's consort. Mitra and Varuna were the inviters: Agni as Hotar took her hand and led her.\n\nThe man, her pledge, must by the hand be taken when he hath cried, She is a Brāhman's consort. She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom of a ruler guarded.\n\nShe whom they call the star with loosened tresses, descending as. misfortune on the village, The Brāhman's consort, she disturbs the kingdom where hath appeared the hare with fiery flashing.\n\nActive in duty serves the Brahmachāri: he is a member of the Gods' own body. Through him Brihaspati obtained his consort, as the Gods gained the ladle brought by Soma.\n\nThus spake of her those Gods of old, Seven Rishis, who sate them down to their austere devotion: Dire is a Brāhman's wife led home by others: in the supremest heaven she plants confusion.\n\nWhen infants die, untimely born, when herds of cattle waste away, When heroes strike each other dead, the Brāhman's wife destroyeth them.\n\nEven if ten former husbands—none a Brāhman—had espoused a dame, And then a Brāhman took her hand, he is her husband, only he,\n\nNot Vaisya, not Rājanya, no, the Brāhman is indeed her lord: This Sūrya in his course proclaims to the Five Races of man- kind.\n\nSo then the Gods restored her, so men gave the woman back again. Princes who kept their promises restored the Brāhman's wedded wife.\n\nHaving restored the Brāhman's wife, and freed them, with Gods' aid, from sin, They shared the fulness of the earth and worn themselves ex- tended sway.\n\nNo lovely wife who brings her dower in hundreds rests upon his bed, Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a Brāhman's dame.\n\nNo broad-browed calf with wide-set ears is ever in his homestead born. Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a Brāhman's dame.\n\nNo steward, golden-necklaced, goes before the meat-trays of the man. Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a Brāhman's dame.\n\nNo black-eared courser, white of hue, moves proudly, harnessed to his car, In whose dominion is detained, through want of sense, a Brāhman's dame.\n\nNo lily grows with oval bulbs, no lotus-pool is in his field, In whose dominion is detained, through senseless love, a Brāhman's dame.\n\nThe men whose task it is to milk drain not the brindled cow for him, In whose dominion is detained, through senseless love, a Brāhman's dame.\n\nHis milch-cow doth not profit one, his draught-ox masters not the yoke, Wherever, severed from his wife, a Brāhman spends the mourn- ful night."

The Brāhman's cow and think, To-day and not tomorrow, let me live!\n\nThe Brāhman's cow is like a snake, charged with due poison, clothed with skin. Rājanya! bitter to the taste is she, and none may eat of her.\n\nShe takes away his strength, she mars his splendour, she ruins everything like fire enkindled. That man drinks poison of the deadly serpent who counts the Brāhman as mere food to feed him.\n\nWhoever smites him, deeming him a weakling-blasphemer, coveting his wealth through folly Indra sets fire alight within his bosom. He who acts thus is loathed by Earth and Heaven.\n\nNo Brāhman must be injured, safe as fire from him who loves himself. For Soma is akin to him and Indra guards him from the curse.\n\nThe fool who eats the Brāhmans' food and thinks it pleasant to the taste, Eats, but can ne'er digest, the cow that bristles with a hundred barbs,\n\nHis voice an arrow's neck, his tongue a bowstring, his windpipes fire-enveloped heads of arrows, With these the Brāhman pierces through blasphemers, with God-sped bows that quell the hearts within them.\n\nKeen arrows have the Brāhmans, armed with missiles: the shaft, when they discharge it, never faileth. Pursuing him with fiery zeal and anger, they pierce the foeman even from a distance.\n\nThey who, themselves ten hundred, were the rulers of a thousand men, The Vaitahavyas, were destroyed for that they ate a Brāhman's cow.\n\nThe cow, indeed, when she was slain o'erthrew those Vaitahavyas, who Cooked the last she-goat that remained of Kesaraprābandhā's flock.\n\nOne and a hundred were the folk, those whom the earth shook off from her: When they had wronged the Brāhman race they perished incon- ceivably.\n\nAmong mankind the Gods' despiser moveth: he hath drunk poison, naught but bone is left him. Who wrongs the kinsman of the Gods, the Brāhman, gains not the sphere to which the Fathers travelled.\n\nAgni, in sooth, is called our guide, Soma is called our next of kin. Indra quells him who curses us. Sages know well that this is so.\n\nPrince! like a poisoned arrow, like a deadly snake, O lord of kine! Dire is the Brāhman's arrow: he pierces his enemies therewith."

Misfortune smites the realm wherein a Brāhman suffers scath and harm.\n\nThe very trees repel the man, and drive him from their sheltering shade, Whoever claims, O Nārada, the treasure that a Brāhman owns.\n\nThat wealth, King Varuna hath said, is poison by the Gods prepared. None hath kept watch to guard his realm who hath devoured a Brāhman's cow.\n\nThose nine-and-ninety people whom Earth shook and cast away from her, When they had wronged the Brāhman race were ruined incon- ceivably.\n\nOppressor of the Brāhmans! thus the Gods have spoken and declared, The step-effacing wisp they bind upon the dead shall be thy couch.\n\nOppressor of the Brāhmans! tears wept by the man who suffers wrong, These are the share of water which the Gods have destined to be thine.\n\nThe share of water which the Gods have destined to be thine, is that, Oppressor of the priest! wherewith men lave the corpse and wet the beard.\n\nThe rain of Mitra-Varuna falls not on him who wrongs the priest.

Endowed with strength, possessing these, be thou the master of thy foes,\n\nThe God who first bound on in the beginning the deities' im- mortal golden castle,— Him I salute with ten extended fingers. Blest be the three- stringed charm I bind upon thee.\n\nAryaman be thy binder-on, and Pūshan and Brihaspati: Whatever name the brood of day possess, therewith we fasten thee.\n\nWith Seasons and with Lengths of Time, for vigour and exten- ded life, With all the splendour of the Sun we fasten thee about the neck.\n\nDrawn forth from butter and with meath besprinkled, firm as the earth, unshakable, triumphant. Breaking down foes and casting them beneath me, be fastened on me for exalted fortune!"

Rend thou, most youthful Agni, that Pisācha whoso amid them all of this hath eaten.\n\nWhatever of his body hath been taken, plundered, borne off, or eaten by Pisāchas, This, Agni, knowing it, again bring hither! We give back flesh and spirit to his body.\n\nIf some Pisācha in my food raw, ready, thoroughly cooked, or, spotty, hath deceived me, Let the Pisāchas with their lives and offspring atone for this, and let this man be healthy.\n\nIf one hath cheated me in milk or porridge, in food from grain or plants that need no culture. Let the Pisāchas, etc.\n\nIf one, flesh eater, in a draught of water have wronged me lying in the bed of goblins, Let the Pisāchas, etc.\n\nIf one, flesh-eater, in the day or night-time have wronged me lying in the bed of goblins, Let the Pisāchas, etc.\n\nO Agni Jātavedas, slay the bloody Pisācha, flesh-devourer, mind- destroyer, Strong Indra strike him with his bolt of thunder, courageous Soma cut his head to pieces!\n\nThou, Agni, ever slayest Yātudhānas, the fiends have never con- quered thee in battles. Consume thou from the root the flesh-devourers, let none of them escape thy heavenly weapon\n\nCollect, O Jātavedas, what hath been removed and borne away. Let this man's members grow, let him swell like the tendril of a plant.\n\nLike as the Soma's tendril, thus, O Jātavedas let him swell, Let him live, Agni I Make him fat, free from consumption, full of sap.\n\nHere, Agni, is the fuel, here are logs that crush Pisāchas down. O Jātavedas, willingly accept them and be pleased therewith.\n\nAccept, O Agni, with thy flame the billets of Tārshtāgha wood. Let the flesh-eater who would take the flesh of this man lose his form."
