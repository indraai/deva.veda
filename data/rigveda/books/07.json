All these my people call thee Lord of cattle: may Indra. come unto the prayer we offer.\np: What though the floods spread widely, Indra made them shallow and easy for Sudās to traverse. He, worthy of our praises, caused the Simyu, foe of our hymn, to curse the rivers' fury.\np: Eager for spoil was Turvaśa Purodas, fain to win wealth, like fishes urged by hunger. The Bhṛgus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid the two distant peoples.\np: Together came the Pakthas, the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the Visanins. Yet to the Trtsus came the Ārya's Comrade, through love of spoil and heroes' war, to lead them.\np: Fools, in their folly fain to waste her waters, they parted inexhaustible Paruṣṇī.

They who drive spotted steeds, sent down by Pṛśni, gave ear, the Warriors and the harnessed horses.\np: The King who scattered one-and-twenty people of both Vaikarna tribes through lust of glory- As the skilled priest clips grass within the chamber, so hath the Hero Indra, wrought their downfall.\np: Thou, thunder-armed, o’erwhelmedst in the waters famed ancient Kavasa and then the Druhyu.

The goods of Anu's son he gave to Trtsu. May we in sacrifice conquer scorned Pūru.\np: The Anavas and Druhyus, seeking booty, have slept, the sixty hundred, yea, six thousand, And six-and-sixty heroes. For the pious were all these mighty exploits done by Indra.\np: These Trtsus under Indra's careful guidance came speeding like loosed waters rushing downward. The foemen, measuring exceeding closely, abandoned to Sudās all their provisions.\np: The hero's side who drank the dressed oblation, Indra's denier, far o’er earth he scattered. Indra brought down the fierce destroyer's fury. He gave them various roads, the path's Controller.\np: E’en with the weak he wrought this matchless exploit: e’en with a goat he did to death a lion. He pared the pillar's angles with a needle. Thus to Sudās Indra gave all provisions.\np: To thee have all thine enemies submitted: e’en the fierce Bheda hast thou made thy subject. Cast down thy sharpened thunderbolt, O Indra, on him who harms the men who sing thy praises.\np: Yamuna and the Trtsus aided Indra. There he stripped Bheda bare of all his treasures. The Ajas and the Sigrus and the Yaksus brought in to him as tribute heads of horses.\np: Not to be scorned, but like Dawns past and recent, O Indra, are thy favours and thy riches. Devaka, Mānyamana's son, thou slewest, and smotest Śambara from the lofty mountain.\np: They who, from home, have gladdened thee, thy servants Parasara, Vasiṣṭha, Satayatu, Will not forget thy friendship, liberal Giver. So shall the days dawn prosperous for the princes.\np: Priest-like, with praise, I move around the altar, earning Paijavana's reward, O Agni, Two hundred cows from Devavan's descendant, two chariots from Sudās with mares to draw them.\np: Gift of Paijavana, four horses bear me in foremost place, trained steeds with pearl to deck them. Sudās's brown steeds, firmly-stepping, carry me and my son for progeny and glory.\np: Him whose fame spreads between wide earth and heaven, who, as dispenser, gives each chief his portion, Seven flowing Rivers glorify like Indra. He slew Yudhyamadhi in close encounter.\np: Attend on him O ye heroic Maruts as on Sudās's father Divodāsa. Further Paijavana's desire with favour. Guard faithfully his lasting firm dominion.",

Then from the midst thereof there rose up Māna, and thence they say was born the sage Vasiṣṭha.\np: He brings the bearer of the laud and Sāman: first shall he speak bringing the stone for pressing. With grateful hearts in reverence approach him: to you, O Pratrdas, Vasiṣṭha cometh.",

Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon.\np: Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn drive off the couples of Kimīdins. Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble: from grief that comes from heaven mid-air preserve us.\np: Slay the male demon, Indra! slay the female, joying and triumphing in arts of magic.
