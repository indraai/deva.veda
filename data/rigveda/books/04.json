      "content": "p: , THEE Agni, have the Gods, ever of one accord, sent hither down, a God, appointed messenger, yea, with their wisdom sent thee down. The Immortal, O thou Holy One, mid mortal men, the God-devoted God, the wise, have they brought forth, brought forth the omnipresent God-devoted Sage.\np: As such, O Agni, bring with favour to the Gods thy Brother Varuṇa who loveth sacrifice, True to the Law, the Āditya who supporteth men, the King, supporter of mankind.\np: Do thou, O Friend, turn hither him who is our Friend, swift as a wheel, like two car-steeds in rapid course, Wondrous! to us in rapid course. O Agni, find thou grace for us with Varuṇa, with Maruts who illumine all. Bless us, thou Radiant One, for seed and progeny, yea, bless us, O thou Wondrous God.\np: Do thou who knowest Varuṇa, O Agni, put far away from us the God's displeasure. Best Sacrificer, brightest One, refulgent remove thou far from us all those who hate us.\np: Be thou, O Agni, nearest us with succour, our closest Friend while now this Morn is breaking. Reconcile to us Varuṇa, be bounteous enjoy the gracious juice; be swift to hear us.\np: Excellent is the glance, of brightest splendour, which the auspicious God bestows on mortals- The God's glance, longed-for even as the butter, pure, heated, of the cow, the milch-cow's bounty.\np: Three are those births, the true, the most exalted, eagerly longed-for, of the God, of Agni. He came invested in the boundless region, pure, radiant, friendly, mightily resplendent.\np: This envoy joyeth in all seats of worship, borne on his golden car, sweet-tongued Invoker: Lovely to look on, with red steeds, effulgent, like a feast rich in food, joyous for ever.\np: Allied by worship, let him give man knowledge: by an extended cord they lead him onward. He stays, effectual in this mortal's dwelling, and the God wins a share in his possessions.\np: Let Agni -for he knows the way- conduct us to all that he enjoys of God-sent riches, What all the Immortals have prepared with wisdom, Dyaus, Sire, Begetter, raining down true blessings.\np: In houses first he sprang into existence, at great heaven's base, and in this region's bosom; Footless and headless, both his ends concealing, in his Bull's lair drawing himself together.\np: Wondrously first he rose aloft, defiant, in the Bull's lair, the homeof holy Order, Longed-for, young, beautiful, and far-resplendent: and sevendear frieuds sprang up unto the Mighty.\np: Here did our human fathers take their places, fain to fulfil the sacred Law of worship. Forth drave they, with loud call, Dawn's teeming Milch-kine bid in the mountainstable, in the cavern.\np: Splendid were they when they had rent the mountain: others, around, shall tell forth this their exploit. They sang their song, prepared to free the cattle: they found the light; with holy hymns they worshipped.\np: Eager, with thought intent upon the booty, the men with their celestial speech threw open, The solid mountain firm, compact, enclosing, confining Cows, the stable full of cattle.\np: The Milch-cow's earliest name they comprehended: they found the Mother's thrice-seven noblest titles. This the bands knew, and sent forth acclamation:with the Bull's sheen the Red One was apparent.\np: The turbid darkness fled, the heaven was sp, endid! up rose the bright beam of celestial Morning. Sūrya ascended to the wide expanses, beholding deeds of men both good and evil.\np: Then, afterwards they looked around, awakened, when first they held that Heaven allotted treasure. Now all the Gods abide in all their dwellings. Varuṇa, Mitra, be the prayer effective.\np: I will call hither brightly-beaming Agni, the Herald, all-supporting, best at worship. He hath disclosed, like the milch cows' pure udder, the Sorria's juice when cleansed and poured from beakers.\np: The freest God of all who should be worshipped, the guest who is received in all men's houses, Agni who hath secured the Gods’ high favour,—may he be gracious, to us Jātavedas.",

Lead us, O God, to wealth and noble offspring: keep penury afar and grant us plenty.\np: This Sage the Sages, ne’er deceived, commanded, setting him down in dwellings of the living. Hence mayst thou, friendly God, with rapid footsteps behold the Gods, wonderful, fair to look on.\np: Good guidance hast thou for the priest, O Agni, who, Youngest God! with outpoured Soma serves thee. Ruler of men, thou joyous God, bring treasure splendid and plentiful to aid the toiler.\np: Now all that we, thy faithful servants, Agni, have done with feet, with hands, and with our bodies, The wise, with toil, the holy rite have guided, as those who frame a car with manual cunning.\np: May we, seven sages first in rank, engender, from Dawn the Mother, men to be ordainers. May we, Aṅgirases, be sons of Heaven, and, radiant, burst the wealth-containing mountain.\np: As in the days of old our ancient Fathers, speeding the work of holy worship, Agni, Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises; they cleft the ground and made red Dawns apparent.\np: Gods, doing holy acts, devout, resplendent, smelting like ore their human generations. Enkindling Agni and exalting Indra, they came encompassing the stall of cattle.\np: Strong One! he marked them-and the Gods before them-like herds of cattle in a foodful pasture. There they moaned forth their strong desire for mortals, to aid the True, the nearest One, the Living.\np: We have worked for thee, we have laboured nobly-bright Dawns have shed their light upon our worship- Adding a beauty to the perfect Agni, and the God's beauteous eye that shines for ever.\np: Agni, Disposer, we have sung these praises to thee the Wise: do thou accept them gladly. Blaze up on high and ever make us richer. Give us great wealth, O thou whose boons are many.",

This with his rays the Great God hath vouchsafed to us.\np: Sustainer of the heaven, Lord of the whole world's life, the Sage, he putteth on his golden-coloured mail. Clear-sighted, spreading far, filling the spacious realm, Savitar hath brought forth bliss that deserveth laud.\np: He hath filled full the regions of the heaven and earth: the God for his own strengthening waketh up the hymn. Savitar hath stretched out his arms to cherish life, producing with his rays and lulling all that moves.\np: Lighting all living creatures, ne’er to be deceived, Savitar, God, protects each holy ordinance. He hath stretched out his arms to all the folk of earth, and, with his laws observed, rules his own mighty course.\np: Savitar thrice surrounding with his mightiness mid-air, three regions, and the triple sphere of light, Sets the three heavens in motion and the threefold earth, and willingly protects us with his triple law.\np: Most gracious God, who brings to life and lulls to rest, he who controls the world, what moves not and what moves, May he vouchsafe us shelter,—Savitar the God,—for tranquil life, with triple bar against distress.\np: With the year's seasons hath Savitar, God, come nigh: may he prosper our home, give food and noble sons. May he invigorate us through the days and nights, and may he send us opulence with progeny.",
