Making over the merit of his own good actions to his friends and the guilt of his evil deeds to his enemies, he attains the eternal Brahman by the practice of meditation. When by the disposition of his heart he becomes indifferent to all objects, he obtains eternal happiness both in this world and after death. He who has in this manner gradually given up all attachments and is freed from all the pairs of opposites, reposes in Brahman alone. All that has been declared depends on meditation. For he who is not proficient in the knowledge of that which refers to the Soul reaps not the full reward of the performance of rites.",

And in accordance with the Veda and of the Smriti, the Householder is declared to be superior to all ofthe; for he supports the other three. As all rivers, both great and small, find a resting-place in the ocean, even so men of all orders find protection with Householders. Men belonging to any of these four orders, the tenfold law must be ever carefully obeyed. Contentment, forgiveness, self-control, abstention from unrighteously appropriating anything, obedience to the rules of purification, coercion of the organs, wisdom, knowledge of the supreme Soul, truthfulness, and abstention from anger, form the tenfold law.",
