For on that desire is grounded the study of the Veda and the performance of the actions, prescribed by the Veda. The desire for rewards, indeed, has its root in the conception that an act can yield them, and in consequence of that conception sacrifices are performed; vows and the laws prescribing restraints are all stated to be kept through the idea that they will bear fruit. Not a single act here below appears ever to be done by a man free from desire; for whatever man does, it is the result of the impulse of desire. One who persists in discharging these prescribed duties in the right manner, reaches the deathless state and even in this life obtains the fulfilment of all the desires that he may have conceived.",
