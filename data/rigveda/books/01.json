He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents.\np: He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder Tvaṣṭar fashioned. Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean.\np: Impetuous as a bull, he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices. Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons.\np: When, Indra, thou hadst slain the dragon's firstborn, and overcome the charms of the enchanters, Then, giving life to Sun and Dawn and Heaven, thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee.\np: Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vṛtra, worst of Vṛtras. As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the earth so lies the prostrate Dragon.\np: He, like a mad weak warrior, challenged Indra, the great impetuous many-slaying Hero. He, brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed—Indra's foe—the shattered forts in falling.\np: Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders. Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus Vṛtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered.\np: There as he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow above him. The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which Vṛtra with his greatness had encompassed.\np: Then humbled was the strength of Vṛtra's mother: Indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her. The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay Danu.\np: Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward. The waters bear off Vṛtra's nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to during darkness.\np: Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dāsas, the waters stayed like kine held by the robber. But he, when he had smitten Vṛtra, opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.\np: A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second, Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers.\np: Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist which had spread around him: When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Maghavan gained the victory for ever.\np: Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him; That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst nine-and-ninety flowing rivers?\np: Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and horned, the Thunder-wielder.

Those charioteers of thine, best skilled to draw the rein, the rapid sunbeams, Indra, lead thee not astray.\np: Thou bearest in both hands treasure that never fails; the famed One in his body holds unvanquished might.

Singing their song of praise and generating might, they have put glory on, the Sons whom Pṛśni bare.\np: When, Children of the Cow, they shine in bright attire, and on their fair limbs lay their golden ornaments, They drive away each adversary from their path, and, following their traces, fatness floweth down,\np: When, mighty Warriors, ye who glitter with your spears, o’erthrowing with your strength e’en what is ne’er o’erthrown, When, O ye Maruts, ye the host that send the rain, had harnessed to your cars the thought-fleet spotted deer.\np: When ye have harnessed to your cars the spotted deer, urging the thunderbolt, O Maruts, to the fray, Forth rush the torrents of the dark red stormy cloud, and moisten, like a skin, the earth with water-floods.\np: Let your swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their fleet pinions. Come ye forward with your arms. Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight yourselves, O Maruts, in the pleasant food.\np: Strong in their native strength to greatness have they grown, stepped to the firmament and made their dwelling wide. When Viṣṇu saved the Soma bringing wild delight, the Maruts sate like birds on their dear holy grass.\np: In sooth like heroes fain for fight they rush about, like combatants fame-seeking have they striven in war. Before the Maruts every creature is afraid: the men are like to Kings, terrible to behold.\np: When Tvaṣṭar deft of hand had turned the thunderbolt, golden, with thousand edges, fashioned more skilfully, Indra received it to perform heroic deeds. Vṛtra he slew, and forced the flood of water forth.\np: They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong. The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds.\np: They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama. Shining with varied light they come to him with help: they with their might fulfilled the longing of the sage.\np: The shelters which ye have for him who lauds you, bestow them threefold on the man who offers. Extend the same boons unto us, ye Maruts. Give us, O Heroes, wealth with noble offspring.",

Struck down, it shall not reach the mark; hurled forth, the fire-brand shall not strike.\np: With riches in abundance, Indra, come to us, come by an unobstructed path, come by a path from demons free. Be with us when we stray afar, be with us when our home is nigh. Protect us with thy help both near and far away: protect us ever with thy help.\np: Thou art our own, O Indra, with victorious wealth: let might accompany thee, the Strong, to give us aid, like Mitra, to give mighty aid.

As both together join to expedite his birth, most youthful he is born resplendent in his light.\np: Then also entered he the Mothers, and in them pure and uninjured he increased in magnitude. As to the first he rose, the vigorous from of old, so now he runs among the younger lowest ones.\np: Therefore they choose him Herald at the morning rites, pressing to him as unto Bhaga, pouring gifts, When, much-praised, by the power and will of Gods, he goes at all times to his mortal worshipper to drink.\np: What time the Holy One, wind-urged, hath risen up, serpent-like winding through the dry grass unrestrained, Dust lies upon the way of him who burneth all, black-winged and pure of birth who follows sundry paths.\np: Like a swift chariot made by men who know their art, he with his red limbs lifts himself aloft to heaven. Thy worshippers become by burning black of hue: their strength flies as before a hero's violence.\np: By thee, O Agni, Varuṇa who guards the Law, Mitra and Aryaman, the Bounteous, are made strong; For, as the felly holds the spokes, thou with thy might pervading hast been born encompassing them round.\np: Agni, to him who toils and pours libations, thou, Most Youthful! sendest wealth and all the host of Gods. Thee, therefore, even as Bhaga, will we set anew, young Child of Strength, most wealthy! in our battle-song.\np: Vouchsafe us riches turned to worthy ends, good luck abiding in the house, and strong capacity, Wealth that directs both worlds as they were guiding-reins, and, very Wise, the Gods’ assent in sacrifice.\np: May he, the Priest resplendent, joyful, hear us, he with the radiant car and rapid horses. May Agni, ever wise, with best directions to bliss and highest happiness conduct us.\np: With hymns of might hath Agni now been lauded, advanced to height of universal kingship. Now may these wealthy chiefs and we together spread forth as spreads the Sun above the rain-clouds.",

Here I behold the Chief with seven male children.\np: Seven to the one-wheeled chariot yoke the Courser; bearing seven names the single Courser draws it. Three-naved the wheel is, sound and undecaying, whereon are resting all these worlds of being.\np: The seven who on the seven-wheeled car are mounted have horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward. Seven Sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the names of the seven Cows are treasured.\np: Who hath beheld him as he sprang to being, seen how the boneless One supports the bony? Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may approach the man who knows, to ask it?\np: Unripe in mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods’ established places; For up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their own seven threads have woven.\np: I ask, unknowing, those who know, the sages, as one all ignorant for sake of knowledge, What was that ONE who in the Unborn's image hath stablished and fixed firm these worlds' six regions.\np: Let him who knoweth presently declare it, this lovely Bird's securely founded station. Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and, wearing his vesture, with their foot have drunk the water.\np: The Mother gave the Sire his share of Order: with thought, at first, she wedded him in spirit. She, the coy Dame, was filled with dew prolific: with adoration men approached to praise her.\np: Yoked was the Mother to the boon Cow's car-pole: in the dank rows of cloud the Infant rested. Then the Calf lowed, and looked upon the Mother, the Cow who wears all shapes in three directions.\np: Bearing three Mothers and three Fathers, single he stood erect: they never make him weary. There on the pitch of heaven they speak together in speech all-knowing but not all-impelling.\np: Formed with twelve spokes, by length of time, unweakened, rolls round the heaven this wheel of during Order. Herein established, joined in pairs together, seven hundred Sons and twenty stand, O Agni.\np: They call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed, of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store. These others say that he, God with far-seeing eyes, is mounted on the lower seven-wheeled, six-spoked car.\np: Upon this five-spoked wheel revolving ever all living creatures rest and are dependent. Its axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient time remains unbroken.\np: The wheel revolves, unwasting, with its felly: ten draw it, yoked to the far-stretching car-pole. The Sun's eye moves encompassed by the region: on him dependent rest all living creatures.\np: Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born; the six twin pairs are called Ṛṣis, Children of Gods. Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and various in their form move for the Lord who guides.\np: They told me these were males, though truly females: he who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not. The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father's father.\np: Beneath the upper realm, above this lower, bearing her calf at foot the Cow hath risen. Witherward, to what place hath she departed? Where calves she? Not amid this herd of cattle.\np: Who, that the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper realm, above the lower, Showing himself a sage, may here declare it? Whence hath the Godlike spirit had its rising?\np: Those that come hitherward they call departing, those that depart they call directed hither. And what so ye have made, Indra and Soma, steeds bear as ’twere yoked to the region's car-pole.\np: Two Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the same sheltering tree have found a refuge. One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's fruitage; the other eating not regardeth only.\np: Where those fine Birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eternal, and the sacred synods, There is the Universe's mighty Keeper, who, wise, hath entered into me the simple.\np: The, tree whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they all rest and procreate their offspring,— Upon its top they say the fig is luscious: none gaineth it who knoweth not the Father.\np: How on the Gāyatrī the Gāyatrī was based, how from the Triṣṭup they fashioned the Triṣṭup forth, How on the Jagatī was based the Jagatī,—they who know this have won themselves immortal life.\np: With Gāyatrī he measures out the praise-song, Sāma with praise-song, triplet with the Triṣṭup. The triplet with the two or four-foot measure, and with the syllable they form seven metres.\np: With Jagatī the flood in heaven he stablished, and saw the Sun in the Rathantara Sāman. Gāyatrī hath, they say, three brands for kindling: hence it excels in majesty and vigour.\np: I invocate the milch-cow good for milking so that the milker, deft of hand, may drain her. May Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron is made hot; I will proclaim it.\np: She, lady of all treasure, is come hither yearning in spirit for her calf and lowing. May this cow yield her milk for both the Aśvins, and may she prosper to our high advantage.\np: The cow hath lowed after her blinking youngling; she licks his forehead, as she lows, to form it. His mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him with milk while gently lowing.\np: He also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow laws as she clings unto the shedder of the rain. She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal man, and, turned to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.\np: That which hath breath and speed and life and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses. Living, by offerings to the Dead he moveth Immortal One, the brother of the mortal.\np: I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by his pathways and departing. He, clothed with gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continually travels.\np: He who hath made him cloth not comprehend him: from him who saw him surely is he hidden. He, yet enveloped in his Mother's bosom, source of much life, hath sunk into destruction.\np: Dyaus is my Father, my begetter: kinship is here. This great earth is my kin and Mother. Between the wide-spread world-halves is the birth-place: the Father laid the Daughter's germ within it.\np: I ask thee of the earth's extremest limit, where is the centre of the world, I ask thee. I ask thee of the Stallion's seed prolific, I ask of highest heaven where Speech abideth.\np: This altar is the earth's extremest limit; this sacrifice of ours is the world's centre. The Stallion's seed prolific is the Soma; this Brahman highest heaven where Speech abideth.\np: Seven germs unripened yet are heaven's prolific seed: their functions they maintain by Viṣṇu's ordinance. Endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought, they compass us about present on every side.\np: What thing I truly am I know not clearly: mysterious, fettered in my mind I wander. When the first-born of holy Law approached me, then of this speech I first obtain a portion.\np: Back, forward goes he, grasped by strength inherent, the Immortal born the brother of the mortal Ceaseless they move in opposite directions: men mark the one, and fail to mark the other.\np: Upon what syllable of holy praise-song, as twere their highest heaven, the Gods repose them,— Who knows not this, what will he do with praise-song? But they who know it well sit here assembled.\np: <A HREF=\"errata.htm#5\">Fortunate</A> mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also be exceeding wealthy. Feed on the grass, O Cow, at every season, and coming hitherward drink limpid water.\np: Forming the water-floods, the buffalo hath lowed, one-footed or two-footed or four-footed, she, Who hath become eight-footed or hath got nine feet, the thousand-syllabled in the sublimest heaven.\np: From her descend in streams the seas of water; thereby the world's four regions have their being, Thence flows the imperishable flood and thence the universe hath life.\np: I saw from far away the smoke of fuel with spires that rose on high o’er that beneath it. The Mighty Men have dressed the spotted bullock. These were the customs in the days aforetime,\np: Three with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them sheareth when the year is ended. One with his powers the universe regardeth: Of one, the sweep is seen, but his figure.\np: Speech hath been measured out in four divisions, the Brahmans who have understanding know them. Three kept in close concealment cause no motion; of speech, men speak only the fourth division.\np: They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutmān. To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan.\np: Dark the descent: the birds are golden-coloured; up to the heaven they fly robed in the waters. Again descend they from the seat of Order, and all the earth is moistened with their fatness.\np: Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it? Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty, which in nowise can be loosened.\np: That breast of thine exhaustless, spring of pleasure, wherewith thou feedest all things that are choicest, Wealth-giver, treasure. finder, free bestower,—bring that, Sarasvatī, that we may drain it.\np: By means of sacrifice the Gods accomplished their sacrifice: these were the earliest ordinances. These Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sādhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.\np: Uniform, with the passing days, this water mounts and fails again. The tempest-clouds give life to earth, and fires re-animate the heaven.\np: The Bird Celestial, vast with noble pinion, the lovely germ of plants, the germ of waters, Him who delighteth us with rain in season, Sarasvān I invoke that he may help us.",

Rings are upon your shoulders when ye journey forth: your axle turns together both the chariot wheels.\np: Held in your manly arms are many goodly things, gold chains are on your chests, and glistering ornaments, Deer-skins are on their shoulders, on their fellies knives: they spread their glory out as birds spread out their wings.\np: Mighty in mightiness, pervading, passing strong, visible from afar as ’twere with stars of heaven, Lovely with pleasant tongues, sweet singers with their mouths, the Maruts, joined with Indra, shout forth all around.\np: This is your majesty, ye Maruts nobly born, far as the sway of Aditi your bounty spreads. Even Indra by desertion never disannuls the boon bestowed by you upon the pious man.\np: This is your kinship, Maruts, that, Immortals, ye were oft in olden time regardful of our call, Having vouchsafed to man a hearing through this prayer, by wondrous deeds the Heroes have displayed their might.\np: That, O ye Maruts, we may long time flourish through your abundant riches, O swift movers, And that our men may spread in the encampment, let me complete the rite with these oblations.\np: May this your laud, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet, Māna's son, Māndārya, Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us.

Lopāmudrā is represented as inviting the caresses of her aged husband Agastya, and complaining of his coldness and neglect. Agastya responds in stanza 3, and in the second half of stanza 4 the disciple or the poet briefly tells the result of the dialogue. Stanza 5 is supposed to be spoken by the disciple who has overheard the conversation, but its connexion with the rest of the hymn is not very apparent. In stanza 6 'toiling with strong endeavour' is a paraphrase and not a translation of the original <i>khanamānaḥ khanītraiḥ</i> (ligonibus fodiens) which Sāyaṇa explains by 'obtaining the desired result by means of lauds and sacrifices.'  \nM. Bergaigne is of opinion that the hymn has a mystical meaning, Agastya being identifiable with the celestial Soma whom Lopāmudrā, representing fervent Prayer, succeeds after long labour in drawing down from his secret dwelling place. See <i>La Religion Vedique</i>, ii. 394 f.  \n\np: 'Through many autumns have I toiled and laboured, at night and morn, through age-inducing dawnings. Old age impairs the beauty of our bodies. Let husbands still come near unto their spouses.\np: For even the men aforetime, law-fulfillers, who with the Gods declared eternal statutes,— They have decided, but have not accomplished: so now let Wives come near unto their husbands.\np: Non inutilis est labor cui Dii favent: nos omnes aemulos et aemulas vincamus. Superemus in hac centum artium pugna in qua duas partes convenientes utrinque commovemus.\np: Cupido me cepit illius tauri [viri] qui me despicit, utrum hinc utrum illinc ab aliqua parte nata sit. Lopamudra taurum [maritum suum] ad se detrahit: insipiens illa sapientem anhelantem absorbet.\np: This Soma I address that is most near us, that which hath been imbibed within the spirit, To pardon any sins we have committed. Verily mortal man is full of longings.\np: Agastya thus, toiling with strong endeavour, wishing for children, progeny and power, Cherished—a sage of mighty strength—both classes, and with the Gods obtained his prayer's fulfilment.  \nBy 'both classes' probably priests and princes, or institutors of sacrifices, are meant. M. Bergaigne understands the expression to mean the two forms or essences of Soma, the celestial and the terrestrial.",
