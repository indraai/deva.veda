Loud hath she lowed, licking Another's offspring. In what world hath the Cow laid down her udder?\np: Seven heroes from the nether part ascended, and from the upper part came eight together. Nine from behind came armed with winnowing-baskets: ten from the front pressed o’er the rock's high ridges.\np: One of the ten, the tawny, shared in common, they send to execute their final purpose. The Mother carries on her breast the Infant of noble form and soothes it while it knows not.\np: The Heroes dressed with fire the fatted wether: the dice were thrown by way of sport and gaming. Two reach the plain amid the heavenly waters, hallowing and with means of purifying.\np: Crying aloud they ran in all directions: One half of them will cook, and not the other. To me hath Savitar, this God, declared it: He will perform, whose food is wood and butter.\np: I saw a troop advancing from the distance moved, not by wheels but their own God-like nature. The Friendly One seeks human generations, destroying, still new bands of evil beings.\np: These my two Bulls, even Pramara's, are harnessed: drive them not far; here let them often linger. The waters even shall aid him to his object, and the all-cleansing Sun who is above us.\np: This is the thunderbolt which often whirleth down from the lofty misty realm of Sūrya. Beyond this realm there is another glory so through old age they pass and feel no sorrow.\np: Bound fast to,every tree the cow is lowing, and thence the man-consuming birds are flying, Then all this world, though pressing juice for Indra and strengthening the Ṛṣi, is affrighted.\np: In the Gods’ mansion stood the first-created, and from their separation came the later. Three warm the Earth while holding stores of water, and Two of these convey the murmuring moisture.\np: This is thy life: and do thou mark and know it. As such, hide not thyself in time of battle. He manifests the light and hides the vapour: his foot is never free from robes that veil it.",

By pleasant ways let them escape the danger, and let foes depart.\np: Signs of good fortune mark the bride come all of you and look at her. Wish her prosperity, and then return unto your homes again.\np: Pungent is this, and bitter this, filled, as it were, with arrow-barbs, Empoisoned andṇot fit for use. The Brahman who knows Sūrya well deserves the garment of the bride.\np: The fringe, the cloth that decks her head, and then the triply parted robe,— Behold the hues which Sūrya wears these doth the Brahman purify.\np: I take thy hand in mine for happy fortune that thou mayst reach old age with me thy husband. Gods, Aryaman, Bhaga, Savitar, Purandhi, have given thee to be my household's mistress.\np: O Pūṣan, send her on as most auspicious, her who shall be the sharer of my pleasures; Her who shall twine her loving arms about me, and welcome all my love and mine embraces.\np: For thee, with bridal train, they, first, escorted Sūrya to her home.

Hearing with love this common invocation, come unto us, pass by all those who praise thee.\np: O Indra, thus may we be made partakers of thy new favours that shall bring us profit. Singing with love, may we the Viśvāmitras win daylight even now through thee, O Indra.\np: Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best hero in the fight where spoil is gathered, The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.",

With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.\np: When amid men in altered shape I sojourned, and through four autumns spent the nights among them, I tasted once a day a drop of butter; and even now with that am I am contented.\np: I, her best love, call Urvasi to meet me, her who fills air and measures out the region.
