      "content": "Agni, spring forth! Here Aditi, afflicted, cooks a Brahmaudana, yearning for children. Let the Seven Rishis, World-creators, rub thee into existence here with gift of offspring.\n\nRaise, as I bid, the smoke, my strong companions, lovers of free- dom from deceit and malice! Victor in fight heroic, here is Agni by whom the Gods subdued the hostile demons.\n\nThou, Agni, wart produced for mighty valour, to cook Brahmau- dana, O Jātavedas. Seven Rishis, makers of the world, begat thee, Grant to this woman wealth with store of heroes.\n\nBurn up, O Agni, kindled with the fuel. Knowing the Gods who merit worship, bring them. Cooking, for these, oblation, Jātavedas! lift up this man to heaven's most lofty summit.\n\nYour portion from of old is triply parted, portion of Gods, of Fathers, and of mortals. Know, all, your shares. I deal them out among you. The portion of the Gods shall save this woman.\n\nStrong art thou, Agni, conquering, all-surpassing. Crush down our foemen, ruin those who hate us. So let this measure, measured, being measured, make all our kin thy tributary vassals.\n\nIncrease with kinsmen and with all abundance: to mighty strength and power lift up this woman. Erect, rise upward to the sky's high station, rise to the lofty world which men call Svarga.\n\nMay this great Earth receive the skin, this Goddess Prithivī, showing us her love and favour. Then may we go unto the world of virtue.\n\nFix on the skin these two joined press-stones, duly rending the fibres for the sacrificer. Strike down and slay those who assail this woman, and elevating raise on high her offspring.\n\nGrasp with thy hand, O man, the well-formed press-stones: the holy Gods have come unto thy worship. Three wishes of thy heart which thou electest, these happy gains for thee I here make ready.\n\nHere thy devotion is, here is thy birthplace. Aditi, Mother of brave sons, accept thee! Wipe away those who fight against this woman with wealth and store of goodly sons endow her.\n\nRest in the roaring frame of wood: be parted from husk and chaff, ye Sacrificial Fibres. May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet the men who hate us.\n\nGo, Dame, and quickly come again: the waters, enclosed, have mounted thee that thou mayst bear them. Take thou of these such as are fit for service: skilfully separating. leave the others.\n\nHither these Dames have come in radiant beauty. Arise and seize= upon thy strength, O woman. To thee hath sacrifice come: take the pitcher, blest with a good lord, children, children's children.\n\nInstructed by the Rishis, bring those waters, the share of strength which was of old assigned you. Let this effectual sacrifice afford you protection, fortune, off- spring, men, and cattle.\n\nAgni, on thee the sacrificial caldron hath mounted: shining,. fiercely flaming, heat it. May hottest flames, divine, sprung from the Rishis, gathering, with the Seasons, heat this portion.\n\nPurified, bright, and holy, let these Women, these lucid waters glide into the caldron. Cattle and many children may they give us. May he who cooks. the Odana go to heaven.\n\nYe, Sacrificial Rice and Soma Fibres, cleansed and made pure by prayer and molten butter. Enter the water: let the caldron take you. May he who dresses this ascend to heaven.\n\nExpand thyself abroad in all thy greatness, with thousand Prish- thas, in the world of virtue. Grandfathers, fathers, children, and descendants, fifteenth am I to thee when I have dressed it.\n\nWith thousand streams and Prishthas, undecaying, Brahmaudana is celestial, God-reaching. Those I give up to thee with all their children. Force them to tribute, but to me be gracious.\n\nRise to the altar: bless this dame with offspring. Promote this woman; drive away the demons. May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet the men who hate us.\n\nApproach this woman here with store of cattle: together with the deities come to meet her. Let not a curse or imprecation reach thee: in thine own seat shine forth exempt from sickness.\n\nFashioned at first by Right, set by the spirit, this altar of Brahmau- dana was appointed. Place the pure boiler on it, woman! set thou therein the rice mess of Celestial Beings.\n\nThis second hand of Aditi, this ladle which the Seven Rishis, world-creators, fashioned. May this scoop deftly pile upon the altar, therein, the members of the rice-oblation.\n\nLet the dressed offering and divine Ones serve thee: creep from. the fire again, own these as masters. Made pure with Soma rest within the Brāhmans: let not thine eaters, Rishis' sons, be injured.\n\nGive understanding unto these, King Soma! all the good Brāh mans who attend and serve thee. Oft, in Brahmaudana, and well I call on: Rishis, their sons, and those who sprang from Fervour.\n\nHere I set singly in the hands of Brāhmans these cleansed and. purifie d and holy Women, May Indra, Marut girt, grant me the blessing which as I sprinkle you, my heart desireth.\n\nHere is my gold, a light immortal: ripened grain from the field this Cow of Plenty give me! This wealth I place among the Brāhmans, making a path that leads to heaven among the Fathers.\n\nLay thou the chaff in Agni Jātavedas: remove the husks and drive them to a distance. That, we have heard, that is the House-Lord's portion: we know the share allotted to Destruction.\n\nMark him who toils and cooks and pours oblation: make this man climb the path that leads to heaven, That he may mount and reach life that is highest, ascending to the loftiest vault above us.\n\nAdhvaryu, cleanse that face of the Supporter. Make room, well knowing, for the molten butter. Purify duly all the limbs with fatness. I make a path to heaven amid the Fathers.\n\nSupporter, send to those men fiends and battle, to all non-Brah- mans who attend and serve thee. Famous and foremost, with their great possessions, let not these here, the Rishis sons, be injured.\n\nI set thee, Odana, with Rishis' children: naught here belongs to men not sprung from Rishis. Let Agni my protector, all the Maruts, the Visve Devas guard the cooked oblation.\n\nMay we adore thee, Sacrifice that yieldeth an everlasting son, cow, home of treasures, Together with increasing store of riches, long life and immor- tality of children.\n\nThou art a Bull that mounts to heaven: to Rishis and their off- spring go. Rest in the world of pious men: there is the place prepared for us.\n\nLevel the ways: go thitherward, O Agni. Make ready thou the Godward-leading pathways. By these our pious actions may we follow sacrifice dwelling in the seven-rayed heaven.\n\nMay we invested with that light go upward, ascending to the sky's most lofty summit. Wherewith the Gods, what time they had made ready Brahmaudana, mounted to the world of virtue."

Shoot not the arrow aimed and drawn against us: forbear to harm our quadrupeds and bipeds.\n\nCast not our bodies to the dog or jackal, nor, Lord of Beasts! to carrion-kites or vultures. Let not thy black voracious flies attack them; let not thy birds obtain them for their banquet.\n\nWe offer homage to thy shout, Bhava! thy breath, thy racking pains: Homage, Immortal One! to thee, to Rudra of the thousand eyes.\n\nWe offer reverence to thee from eastward, and from north and south, From all the compass of the sky, to thee and to the firmament.\n\nHomage, O Bhava, Lord of Beasts, unto thy face and all thine eyes, To skin, and hue, and aspect, and to thee when looked at from behind!\n\nWe offer homage to thy limbs, thy belly, and thy tongue, and mouth we offer homage to thy smell.\n\nNever may we contend with him, the mighty archer, thousand- eyed. Rudra who wears black tufts of hair, the slaughterer of Ardhaka.\n\nMay he, may Bhava from all sides avoid us, avoid us even as fire avoids the waters. Let him not threaten us. To him be homage!\n\nFour times, eight times be homage paid to Bhava, yea, Lord of Beasts, ten times be reverence paid thee! Thine are these animals, five several classes, oxen, and goats and sheep, and men, and horses\n\nThine the four regions, thine are earth and heaven, thine, Mighty One, this firmament between them; Thine everything with soul and breath here on the surface of the land.\n\nThine is this ample wealth-containing storehouse that holds with- in it all these living creatures. Favour us, Lord of Beasts, to thee be homage! Far from us go ill-omens, dogs, and jackals, and wild-haired women with their horrid shrieking!\n\nA yellow bow of gold thou wieldest, slaying its hundred, tufted God! smiting its thousand. Weapon of Gods, far flies the shaft of Rudra: wherever it may be, we pay it homage.\n\nThou, Rudra, followest close the foe who lies in wait to conquer thee. Even as a hunter who pursues the footsteps of the wounded game.\n\nAccordant and allies, Bhava and Rudra, with mighty strength ye go to deeds of valour. Wherever they may be, we pay them homage.\n\nBe homage, Rudra, unto thee approaching and departing hence! Homage to thee when standing still, to thee when seated and at rest!\n\nHomage at evening and at morn, homage at night, homage by day . To Bhava and to Sarva, both, have I paid lowly reverence,\n\nLet us not outrage with our tongue far-seeing Rudra, thousand- eyed, Inspired with varied lore, who shoots his arrows forward, far away.\n\nForemost we go to meet his car, the chariot of the long-haired God, Drawn by brown horses, dusky, black, o'erthrowing, slaying, terrible. Let reverence be paid to him.\n\nCast not thy club at us, thy heavenly weapon. Lord of Beasts, be not wroth with us. Let reverence be paid to thee. Shake thy celestial branch above some others elsewhere, not o'er us.\n\nDo us no harm, but comfort us: avoid thou us, and be not wroth. Never let us contend with thee.\n\nCovet not thou our kine or men, covet not thou our goats or sheep. Elsewhither, strong One! turn thine aim: destroy the mockers' family.\n\nHomage to him whose weapon, Cough or Fever, assails one like the neighing of a stallion; to him who draws one forth and then another!\n\nHomage be paid him with ten Sakvari verses who stands established in the air's mid-region, slaying non-sacrificing God-despisers!\n\nFor thee were forest beasts and sylvan creatures placed in the wood, and small birds, swans, and eagles. Floods, Lord of Beasts! contain thy living beings: to swell thy strength flow the celestial Waters.\n\nPorpoises, serpents, strange aquatic monsters, fishes, and things unclean at which thou shootest. Nothing is far for thee, naught checks thee, Bhava! The whole earth in a moment thou surveyest. From the east sea thou smitest in the northern.\n\nO'erwhelm us not with Fever or with poison, nor, Rudra! with the fire that comes from heaven. Elsewhere, and not on us, cast down this lightning.\n\nRuler of heaven and Lord of earth is Bhava: Bhava hath filled the spacious air's mid-region. Where'er he be, to him be paid our homage!\n\nKing Bhava, favour him who offers worship, for thou art Pasupati, Lord of victims. Be gracious to the quadruped and biped of the believer in the Gods' existence.\n\nHarm thou among us neither great nor little, not one who bears us, not our future bearers. Injure no sire among us, harm no mother. Forbear to injure our own bodies, Rudra.\n\nThis lowly reverence have I paid to Rudra's dogs with mighty mouths, Hounds terrible with bark and howl, who gorge unmasticated food.\n\nHomage to thy loud-shouting hosts and thy long-haired followers! Homage to hosts that are adored, homage to armies that enjoy Homage to all thy troops, O God. Security and bliss be ours!"

Heaven and Earth are the ears, the Sun and Moon are the eyes, the seven Rishis are the vital airs inhaled and exhaled. 3. Vision is the pestle, Desire the mortar. 4. Diti is the winnowing basket, Aditi is she who holds it, Vāta is the sifter. 5. Horses are the grains, oxen the winnowed ricegrains, gnats the husks. 6. Kabru is the husked grain, the rain cloud is the reed. 7. Grey iron is its flesh, copper its blood. 8. Tin is its ashes, gold its colour, the blue lotus flower its scent. 9. The threshing-floor is its dish, the wooden swords its shoulders, the car-shafts its backbones. 10. Collar-bones are its entrails, straps its intestines. 11. This earth, verily becomes the jar, and heaven the cover of the Odana as it is cooking. 12. Furrows are its ribs, sandy soils the undigested contents of its stomach. 13. Law is its water for the hands and family custom its aspersion. 14. The jar covered with the Rich has been solemnly directed by the priestly office. 15. Received by the Brāhman, it has been carried round. 16. The Brihat is, the stirring-spoon, the Rathantara the ladle. 17. The Seasons are the dressers, the Groups of Seasons kindle the fire. 18. The caldron flames round the oblation (<i>charu</i>) whose mouth consists of five openings. \n\n19. The sacrificial word, all worlds are to be won with Odana. \n\n20. Whereon in order rest the three, the ocean, and the heaven, and earth. \n\n21. Within the residue whereof the Gods arranged six eightieth parts— \n\n22. I ask thee, of this Odana what is the mighty magnitude. \n\n23. He who may know the magnitude of the Odana. 24. Would say, Not small, nor devoid of moistening sauce; not this, nor any- thing whatever. 25. He would not declare it to be greater than the giver imagines it to be. 26. The theologians say, Thou hast eaten the averted Odana and the Odana turned hither- ward. 27. Thou hast eaten the Odana and the Odana will eat thee. 28. Thou hast eaten this averted; thy inward breath will leave thee; so he said to this one. 29. Thou hast eaten this turned hitherward; thy downward breath will leave thee; so he said to this one. 30. I indeed have not eaten the Odana, nor has the Odana eaten me. 31. The Odana has just eaten the Odana.   \n \n\n32. And thence he said to this one, Thou hast eaten this with a different head from that with which the ancient Rishis ate: thy offspring, reckoning from the eldest, will die. I have eaten it neither turned downward, nor turned away, nor turned hitherward. With Brihaspati as head: with him I have eaten, with him have I come to it. Now this Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he who possess this knowledge. 33. And thence he said to him, Thou hast eaten this with other ears than those with which the ancient Rishis ate it. Thou wilt be deaf. I have eaten it neither, etc. (as in verse 32). With Heaven and Earth as ears, with these I have eaten it, with these I have come to it. Now this Odana, etc. (as in 32). 34. And thence he said to him. Thou hast eaten this with other eyes . . . thou wilt be blind. With Sun and Moon, etc. 35. And thence, etc. . . with other month. Thy offspring will die, reckoning from the head . . . With Brahma as mouth. 36. And thence, etc. . . . with other tongue . . . Thy tongue will die . . . With the tongue of Agni. 37. And thence, etc. . . With other teeth . . . Thy teeth will fall out . . . With the Seasons as teeth. 38. And thence, etc. . . . with other vital airs. . . . Thy vital airs will leave thee . . . With the Seven Rishis as the vital airs. 39. And thence, etc. . . . with other expanse . . . Consumption will destroy thee . . . With the firmament as expanse. 40 And thence, etc. . . . with other back. . . . Lightning will slay thee. . . With the heaven as back. 41. And thence, etc. . . . with other breast . . . Thou wilt fail in agriculture. . . . With the earth as breast. 42.

With the sea as abdomen. 44. And thence, etc. . . . with other thighs . . . Thy thigh will perish . . . With Mitra-Varuna as thighs. 45. And thence, etc. . . . with other knees . . . Thou wilt become a sick man . . . With the knees of Tvashtar. 46. And thence, etc. . . . with other feet . . . Thou wilt become a wanderer . . . With the feet of the Asvins. 47.

The Brāhmana (divine power) will kill thee . . . With the hands of Right. 49. And thence, etc. . . . with other basis . . . Without standing-ground and resting-place thou wilt die . . .

Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he who possesses this knowledge."

      "content": "Homage to Prāna, him who hath dominion o'er the universe, Who hath become the Sovran Lord of all, on whom the whole depends!\n\nHomage, O Prāna, to thy roar, to thunder-peal and lightning flash! Homage, O Prāna, unto thee what time thou sendest down thy rain!\n\nWhen Prāna with a thunderous voice shouts his loud message to the plants, They straightway are impregnate, they conceive, and bear abundantly.\n\nWhen the due season hath arrived and Prāna shouteth to herbs, Then all is joyful, yea, each thing upon the surface of the earth.\n\nWhen Prāna hath poured down his flood of rain upon the mighty land. Cattle and beasts rejoice thereat: Now great will he our strength, they cry.\n\nWatered by Prāna's rain the plants have raised their voices in accord: Thou hast prolonged our life, they say, and given fragrance to us all.\n\nHomage to thee when coming nigh, homage to thee departing hence! Homage, O Prāna, be to thee when standing and when sitting still.\n\nHomage to thee at every breath thou drawest in and sendest forth! Homage to thee when turned away, homage to thee seen face to face! This reverence be to all of thee!\n\nPrāna, communicate to us thy dear, thy very dearest form. Whatever healing balm thou hast, give us thereof that we may live.\n\nPrāna robes living creatures as a father his beloved son. Prāna is sovran Lord of all, of all that breathes not, all that breathes\n\nPrāna is Fever, he is Death. Prāna is worshipped by the Gods. Prāna sets in the loftiest sphere the man who speaks the words of truth.\n\nPrāna is Deshtri, and Virāj Prāna is reverenced by all. He is the Sun, he is the Moon. Prāna is called Prajāpati.\n\nBoth breaths are rice and barley, and Prāna is called the toiling ox: In barley is the inbreath laid, and rice is named the outward breath.\n\nThe human infant in the womb draws vital breath and sends it Lout: When thou, O Prāna, quickenest the babe it springs anew to life.\n\nThe name of Prāna is bestowed on Mātarisvan and on Wind. On Prāna, past and future, yea, on Prāna everything depends.\n\nAll herbs and plants spring forth and grow when thou, O Prāna quickenest, Plants of Atharvan, Angiras, plants of the deities and men.\n\nWhen Prāna hath poured down his flood of rain upon the mighty earth, The plants are wakened into life, and every herd that grows on ground.\n\nThe man who knows this truth of thee, O Prāna, and what bears thee up To him will all present their gift of tribute in that loftiest will all present their gift of tribute in that loftiest world.\n\nAs all these living creatures are thy tributaries, Prāna, so Shall they bring tribute unto him who hears thee with attentive ears.\n\nFilled with a babe, mid deities he wanders: grown; near at hand, he springs again to being. That Father, grown the present and the future, hath past into the son with mighty powers.\n\nHansa, what time he rises up, leaves in the flood one foot un- moved. If he withdrew it there would be no more tomorrow or to-day, Never would there be night, no more would daylight shine or morning flush.\n\nIt rolleth on, eight-wheeled and single-fellied, and with a thousand eyes, forward and backward. With one half it engendered all creation. What sign is there to tell us of the other?\n\nHomage, O Prāna unto thee armed with swift bow among the rest, In whose dominion is this All of varied sort that stirs and works!\n\nMay he who rules this Universe of varied sort, that stirs and works, Prāna, alert and resolute, assist me through the prayer I pray.\n\nErect among the sleepers he wakes, and is never laid at length, No one hath ever heard that he hath been asleep while others slept.\n\nThou, Prāna, never shalt be hid, never shalt be estranged from me. I bind thee on myself for life, O Prāna, like the Waters' germ."

      "content": "Stirring both worlds the Brahmachāri moveth: in him the deities are all one-minded. He hath established firmly earth and heaven: he satisfies his Master with his Fervour.\n\nAfter the Brahmachārī go the Fathers, the heavenly hosts, all Gods in separate order. After him too have the Gandharvas followed, thirty and three, three hundred, and six thousand. He satisfies all Gods with his devotion.\n\nThe Master, welcoming his new disciple, into his bowels takes the Brahmachāri. Three nights he holds and bears him in this belly. When he is born, the Gods convene to see him.\n\nThis log is earth, the second log is heaven: he fills the air's mid region with the fuel. With fuel, with his zone the Brahmachāri contents the worlds, with labour and with Fervour.\n\nThe Brahmachāri, earlier born than Brahma, sprang up through Fervour, robed in hot libation. From him sprang heavenly lore, the highest Brahma, and all the Gods, with life that lasts for ever.\n\nLighted by fuel goes the Brahmachāri, clad in black-buck skin, consecrate, long-bearded. Swiftly he goes from east to northern ocean, grasping the worlds, oft bringing them anear him.\n\nThe Brahmachāri, fathering Prayer, world, Waters, Virāj, Prajā- pati, and Parameshthin, Lay as a germ within the Immortal's bosom, then became Indra and destroyed the demons.\n\nThe Master fashioned both these cloudy regions, profound and spacious pair, the earth and heaven. The Brahmachāri guards them with his Fervour. In him the deities are all one-minded.\n\nThe Brahmachāri first of all brought hither this ample earth as alms, and heaven above it. He makes these twain two fuel-logs, and worships, On these sup- ported rest all living creatures.\n\nBoth treasuries of sacred lore lie hidden, one hitherward, beyond heaven's ridge the other. The Brahmachārī with his Fervour guards them. He makes this all his own as knowing Brahma.\n\nHitherward one, hence from the earth the other, two Agnis meet between these cloudy regions. Close to these two firm rays of light are clinging. The Brahma- chāri enters them through Fervour.\n\nThundering, shouting, ruddy-hued, and pallid, he bears along the earth great manly vigour. Down on the ridge of earth the Brahmachāri pours seed, and this gives life to heaven's four regions.\n\nThe Brahmachāri stores with fuel Waters, and Fire, and Sun, and Moon, and Mātarisvan. The Water's lights move separate in the rain-cloud, Man, rain, and water are their molten butter.\n\nThe Master is Death, Varuna, Soma, the plants of earth, and milk. The thunder-clouds were men of war. By these this heavenly light was brought.\n\nVaruna, made a Master, takes at home the butter to himself. Whatever with Prajāpati he sought, the Brahmachāri gave like Mitra from his loftiest soul.\n\nThe pupil is the Master, yea, the pupil is Prajāpati. Prajāpati shines bright; the bright Virāj grew potent Indra's self.\n\nBy Fervour and by self-restraint the King protects the realm he rules. By self-restraint the Master seeks a Brahmachari to instruct.\n\nBy self-restraint a maiden finds a youth to be her wedded lord. By self-restraint the ox and horse seek to win fodder for them- selves.\n\nBy Fervour and by self-restraint the Gods draye Death away from them, And Indra brought by self-restraint heaven's lustre to the deities.\n\nThe plants, what is and what shall be, day, night, the tall tree of the wood, The year with seasons of the year, all from the Brahmachāri sprang.\n\nAll creatures of the earth and heaven, tame animals and sylvan beasts, Winged and wingless creatures, from the Brahmachāri sprang to life,\n\nAll children of Prajāpati have breath distinctly in themselves. The Brahma that is stored within the Brahmachāri guards them all.\n\nPiled up on high, but never yet ascended, that power of deities is brightly shining. From that sprang heavenly lore, the loftiest Brahma, and all the Gods with, life that lasts for ever.\n\nThe Brahmachāri wields the radiant Brahma wherein all Gods are woven close together; Creating breath, inhaling and exhaling, voice, mind, and heart, Brahma and holy wisdom.\n\nBestow on us the power of sight and hearing, glory and food and seed and blood and belly.\n\nThese, standing on the flood, the Brahmachāri formed practising in sea his hot devotion. When he hath bathed, brown, yellow-hued, he shines exceedingly on earth."

These were the wooers of the bride; Brahma the chief who courted her.\n\nTen Gods before the Gods were born together in the ancient time. Whoso may know them face to face may now pronounce the mighty word.\n\nInbreath and outbreath, eye and ear, decay and freedom from. decay, Spiration upward and diffused, voice, mind have brought us wish and plan.\n\nAs yet the Seasons were unborn, and Dilator and Prajāpati, Both Asvins, Indra, Agni. Whom then did they worship as supreme?\n\nFervour and Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy sea; Fervour sprang up from Action: this they served and worship- ped as supreme.\n\nHe may account himself well versed in ancient time who knows by name. The earth that was before this earth, which only wisest Sages know.\n\nFrom whom did Indra spring? from whom sprang Soma? whence was Agni born? From whom did Tvashtar spring to life? and whence is Dilator's origin?\n\nIndra from Indra, Soma from Soma, Agni from Agni sprang Tvashtar from Tvashtar was produced, Dilator was Dhātar's origin.\n\nThose Gods who were of old, the Ten begotten earlier than the Gods, What world do they inhabit since they gave the world unto their sons?\n\nWhen he had brought together hair, sinew and bone, marrow and flesh. And to the body added feet, then to what world did he depart?\n\nWhence, from what region did he bring the hair, the sinews, and the bones, Marrow and limbs, and joints, and flesh? Who was the bringer, and from whence?\n\nCasters, those Gods were called who brought together all the elements: When they had fused the mortal man complete, they entered into him.\n\nThe thighs, the knee-bones, and the feet, the head, the face, Land both the hands, The ribs, the nipples, and the sides—what I ishi hath constructed that?\n\nHead, both the hands, and face, and tongue, and neck, and inter- coastal parts, All this, investing it with skins, Mahi conjoined with bond and tie.\n\nWhat time the might body lay firmly compact with tie and bond, Who gave its colour to the form, the hue wherewith it shines to-day?\n\nAll Deities had lent their aid: of this a noble Dame took note, Tsā, the Consort of Command. She gave its colour to the form.\n\nWhen Tvashtar, Tvashtar's loftier Sire, had bored it out and hollowed it. Gods made the mortal their abode, and entered and possessed the man.\n\nSleep, specially, Sloth, Nirriti, and deities whose name is Sin, Baldness, old age, and hoary hairs within the body found their way.\n\nTheft, evil-doing, and deceit, truth, sacrifice, exalted fame, Strength, princely power, and energy entered the body as a home.\n\nProsperity and poverty, kindnesses and malignities, Hunger and thirst of every kind entered the body as a home.\n\nReproaches, freedom from reproach, all blamable, all blameless deeds, Bounty, belief, and unbelief entered the body as a home.\n\nAll knowledge and all ignorance, each other thing that one may learn, Entered the body, prayer, and hymns, and songs, and sacrificial texts.\n\nEnjoyments, pleasures, and delights, gladness, and rapturous ecstasies. Laughter and merriment and dance entered the body as a home.\n\nDiscourse and conversation, and the shrill-resounding cries of woe, All entered in, the motives and the purposes combined there- with.\n\nInbreath and outbreath, ear and eye, decay and freedom from decay. Breath upward and diffused, voice, mind, these quickly with the body move,\n\nAll earnest wishes, all commands, directions, and admonish- ments. Reflections, all deliberate plans entered the body as a home.\n\nThey laid in the abhorrent frame those waters hidden, bright, and thick, Which in the bowels spring from blood, from mourning or from hasty toil.\n\nFuel they turned to bone, and then they set light waters in the frame. The molten butter they made seed: then the Gods entered into man.\n\nAll Waters, all the Deities. Virāj with Brahma at her side: Brahma into the body passed: Prajāpati is Lord thereof.\n\nThe Sun and Wind formed, separate, the eye and vital breath of man. His other person have the Gods bestowed on Agni as a gift.\n\nTherefore whoever knoweth man regardeth him as Brāhman's self: For all the Deities abide in him as cattle in their pen.\n\nAt his first death he goeth hence, asunder, in three separate parts. He goeth yonder with one part, with one he goeth yonder: here he sinketh downward with a third.\n\nIn the primeval waters cold the body is deposited. In this there is the power of growth: from this is power of growth declared."

Slay thou each bravest man of them: with this our army slaughter them.\n\nLow lie the warrior, mailed, unmailed, each foeman in the rush of war. Down-smitten with the strings of bows, the fastenings of mail, the charge!\n\nThe armour-clad, the armourless, enemies clothed with coats of mail, All these struck down, O Arbudi, let dogs devour upon the earth.\n\nCar-borne and carless fighting men, riders and those who go on foot, All these, struck down, let vultures, kites, and all, the birds of air devour.\n\nLow let the hostile army lie, thousands of corpses, on the ground, Pierced through and rent to pieces where the deadly weapons clash in fight.\n\nWith eagles let them eat the evil-hearted, pierced in the vitals, lying crushed and howling. The foe whoe'er will fight against this our protecting sacrifice.\n\nWith this which Gods attend, with this which never fails to gain its end, Let Indra, Vritra-slayer, smite, and with Trishandhi as a bolt."
