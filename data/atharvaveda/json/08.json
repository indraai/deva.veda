      "content": "Homage to Death the Ender! May thy breathings, inward and outward, still remain within thee. Here stay this man united with his spirit in the Sun's realm, the world of life eternal!\n\nBhaga hath lifted up this man, and Soma with his filaments, Indra and Agni, and the Gods the Maruts, raised him up to health.\n\nHere is thy spirit, here thy breath, here is thy life, here is thy soul: By a celestial utterance we raise thee from Destruction's bonds.\n\nUp from this place, O man, rise! sink not downward, casting away the bonds of Death that hold thee. Be not thou parted from this world, from sight of Agni and the Sun.\n\nPurely for thee breathe Wind and Mātarisvan, and let the Waters rain on thee their nectar. The Sun shall shine with healing on thy body; Death shall have mercy on thee: do not leave us!\n\nUpward must be thy way, O man, not downward: with life and mental vigour I endow thee. Ascend this car eternal, lightly rolling; then full of years shalt thou address the meeting.\n\nLet not thy soul go thither, nor be lost to us: slight not the living, go not where the Fathers are. Let all the Gods retain thee here in safety.\n\nYearn not for the departed ones, for those who lead men far away. Rise up from darkness into light: come, both thy hands we clasp in ours.\n\nLet not the black dog and the brindled seize thee, two warders of the way sent forth by Yama. Come hither; do not hesitate: with mind averted stay not there.\n\nForbear to tread this path, for it is awful: that path I speak of which thou hast not travelled. Enter it not, O man; this way is darkness: forward is danger, hitherward is safety.\n\nThy guardians be the Fires within the Waters, thy guardian be the Fire which men enkindle. Thy guardian be Vaisvānara Jātavedas; let not celestial Fire with lightning burn thee.\n\nLet not the Flesh-Consumer plot against thee: depart thou far away from the Destroyer. Be Heaven and Earth and Sun and Moon thy keepers, and from the dart of Gods may Air protect thee.\n\nMay Vigilance and Watchfulness protect thee, Sleepless and Slumberless keep guard above thee! Let Guardian and let Wakeful be thy warders.\n\nLet these be thy preservers, these thy keepers. All hail to these, to these be lowly worship!\n\nMay saving Savitar, Vāyu, Indra, Dhātar restore thee to com- munion with the living. Let not thy vigour or thy breath forsake thee: we recall thy life.\n\nLet not the fiend with snapping jaws, nor darkness find thee: tongue, holy grass: how shouldst thou perish? May the Ādityas and the Vasus, Indra and Agni raise thee and to health restore thee.\n\nThe Sky hath raised thee, and the Earth, Prajāpati hath raised thee up. The Plants and Herbs with Soma as their King have rescued thee from Death.\n\nHere let this man, O Gods, remain: let him not go to yonder world. We rescue him from Mrityu with a charm that hath a thousand powers.\n\nI have delivered thee from Death. Strength-givers smelt and fashion thee! Let not she-fiends with wild loose locks, or fearful howlers yell at thee.\n\nI have attained and captured thee: thou hast returned restored to youth. Perfect in body: so have I found all thy sight and all thy life.\n\nLife hath breathed on thee; light hath come: darkness hath past away from thee. Far from thee we have buried Death, buried Destruction and: Decline."

      "content": "Seize to thyself this trust of life for ever: thine be longevity which nothing shortens. Thy spirit and thy life again I bring thee: die not, nor vanish into mist and darkness.\n\nCome to the light of living men, come hither: I draw thee to a life of hundred autumns. Loosing the bonds of Death, the curse that holds thee, I give thee age of very long duration.\n\nThy breath have I recovered from the Wind, thy vision from the Sun. Thy mind I stablish and secure within thee: feel in thy members,. use thy tongue, conversing.\n\nI blow upon thee with the breath of bipeds and quadrupeds, as on a fire new-kindled. To thee, O Death, and to thy sight and breath have I paid reverence.\n\nLet this man live, let him not die: we raise him, we recover him. I make for him a healing balm. O Death, forbear to slay this man.\n\nHere for sound health I invocate a living animating plant, Preserving, queller of disease, victorious, full of power and might.\n\nSeize him not, but encourage and release him: here let him stay, though thine, in all his vigour. Bhava and Sarva, pity and protect him: give him full life and drive away misfortunes.\n\nComfort him, Death, and pity him: let him arise and pass away, Unharmed, with all his members, hearing well, with old, may he through hundred years win profit with his soul.\n\nMay the Gods' missile pass thee by. I bring thee safe from the mist: from death have I preserved thee. Far have I banished flesh-consuming Agni: I place a rampart for thy life's protection.\n\nSaving him from that misty path of thine which cannot be defined. From that descent of thine, O Death, we make for him a shield of prayer.\n\nI give thee both the acts of breath, health, lengthened life, and death by age. All Yama's messengers who roam around, sent by Vaivasvata, I chase away.\n\nFar off we drive Malignity, Destruction, Pisāchas banqueters on flesh, and Grāhi. And all the demon kind, the brood of sin, like darkness, we dispel.\n\nI win thy life from Agni, from the living everlasting Jātavedas. This I procure for thee, that thou, undying, mayst not suffer harm, that thou mayst be content, that all be well with thee.\n\nGracious to thee be Heaven and Earth, bringing no grief, and drawing nigh! Pleasantly shine the Sun for thee, the Wind blow sweetly to thy heart! Let the celestial Waters full of milk flow happily for thee.\n\nAuspicious be the Plants to thee! I have upraised thee, borne thee from the lower to the upper earth: Let the two Sons of Aditi, the Sun and Moon, protect thee there.\n\nWhatever robe to cover thee or zone thou makest for thyself, We make it pleasant to thy frame: may it be soft and smooth to touch.\n\nWhen, with a very keen and cleasing razor, our hair and beards thou shavest as a barber, Smoothing our face steal not our vital forces.\n\nAuspicious unto thee be rice and barley, causing no painful sick- ness or consumption, these deliver from calamity.\n\nThy food, thy drink, whate'er they be corn grown by cultivation, milk, Food eatable, uneatable, I make all poisonless for thee.\n\nWe give thee over as a charge to Day and Night, in trust to both. Keep him for me from stingy fiends, from those who fain would feed on him.\n\nA hundred, yea, ten thousand years we give thee, ages two, three, four. May Indra, Agni, all the Gods, with willing favour look on thee.\n\nTo Autumn we deliver thee, to Winter, Spring and Summer's care. We trust thee with auspicious years wherein the plants and herbs grow up.\n\nDeath is the lord of bipeds, Death is sovran lord of quadrupeds. Away I bear thee from that: Death the ruler: be not thou afraid.\n\nThou, still uninjured, shalt not die: be not afraid; thou shalt not die. Here where I am men do not die or go to lowest depths of gloom.\n\nHere verily all creatures live, the cow, the horse, the man, the beast, Here where this holy prayer is used, a rampart that protecteth life. Let it preserve thee from thy peers, from incantation, from thy friends.\n\nLive very long, be healthy, be immortal: let not the vital breath forsake thy body.\n\nOne and a hundred modes of death, dangers that may be over- come, May Gods deliver thee from this when Agni, dear to all men, bids.\n\nBody of Agni prompt to save, slayer of fiends and foes art thou, Yea, banisher of malady, the healing balm called Pūtudru."

      "content": "I balm with oil the mighty demon-slayer, to the most famous friend I come for shelter. Enkindled, sharpened by our rites, may Agni protect us in the day and night from evil.\n\nO Jātavedas, armed with teeth of iron, enkindled with thy flame, attack the demons. Seize with thy tongue the foolish gods' adorers: rend, put with- in thy mouth the raw-flesh-eaters.\n\nApply thy teeth, the upper and the lower, thou who hast both, enkindled and destroying. Roam also in the air, O King, around us, and with thy jaws assail the wicked spirits.\n\nPierce through the Yātudhāna's skin, O Agni; let the destroying dart with fire consume him. Rend his joints, Jātavedas! let the eater of raw flesh, seeking flesh, tear and destroy him.\n\nWhere now thou seest, Agni Jātavedas! a Yātudhāna, standing still or roaming. Or one that flieth through the air's mid-region, kindled to fury as an archer pierce him.\n\nBending thy shafts through sacrifices, Agni! dipping thine arrows in the hymn to point them, Pierce to the heart therewith the Yātudhānas, and break their arms uplifted to attack thee.\n\nRescue the captives also, Jātavedas! yea, those whom Yātudhā- nas' spears have captured. Strike down that fiend, blazing before him, Agni! Let spotted carrion-eating kites devour him.\n\nHere tell this forth, O Agni: whosoever is, he himself, or acteth as, a demon, Grasp him, O thou most youthful, with thy fuel: to the Man- Seer's eye give him as booty.\n\nWith keen glance guard the sacrifice, O Agni: thou Sage, con- duct it onward to the Vasus. Let not the fiends, O Man-Beholder, harm thee burning against the Rākshasas to slay them.\n\nLook on the fiend, 'mid men, as Man-Beholder: rend thou his three extremities in pieces. Demolish with thy flame his ribs, O Agni: the Yātudhāna's root destroy thou triply.\n\nThrice, Agni, let thy noose surround the demon who with his falsehood injures holy Order. Loud roaring with thy flame, Jātavedas, fetter him in the pre- sense of the singer.\n\nAgni, what curse the pair this day may utter, what rude rough word the worshippers have spoken, Each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spirit,—pierce to the heart therewith the Yātudhānas.\n\nWith fervent heat exterminate the demons: destroy the fiends with glow and flame, O Agni. Destroy with fire the foolish gods' adorers: destroy the insatiate fiercely-burning creatures.\n\nMay Gods destroy to-day the evil-doer: may uttered curses turn again and strike him. Let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals, and Visva's net enclose the Yātudhāna.\n\nThe fiend who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow's milk away, O Agni,—tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.\n\nLet the fiends steal the poison of the cattle: may Aditi cast off the evil-doers. May the God Savitar give them up to ruin, and be their share of herbs and plants denied them.\n\nThe cow gives milk each year, O Man-Beholder: let not the Yātudhāna ever taste it. Agni, if one should glut him with the biestings, pierce with thy flame his vitals as he meets thee.\n\nAgni, from days of old thou slayest demons: never have Rākshasas in fight o'ercome thee. Burn up the foolish ones, the flesh-devourers: let none of them escape thy heavenly arrow.\n\nGuard us, O Agni, from above and under, protect us from be- hind and from before us; And may thy flames, most fierce and never wasting, glowing with fervent heat, consume the sinner.\n\nFrom rear, from front, from under, from above us, Agni, pro- tect us as a sage with wisdom. Guard to old age thy friend as friend eternal: O Agni, as im- mortal, guard us mortals.\n\nLend thou the worshipper that eye, O Agni, where with thou lookest on the hoof-armed demons. With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the fool who ruins truth with falsehood.\n\nWe set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni! thee, a sage, In conquering colour day by day, destroyer of the treacherous foe.\n\nWith deadly poison strike thou back the treacherous brood of Rākshasas, O Agni, with thy sharpened glow, with rays that flash with points of flame.\n\nAgni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his great- ness makes all things apparent. He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the ogres.\n\nThy two unwasting horns, O Jātavedas, keen-pointed weapons, sharpened by devotion With these transfix the wicked-souled Kimidin, with fierce flame, Jātavedas! when he meets thee.\n\nBright, radiant, meet to be adored, immortal with refulgent glow, Agni drives Rākshasas away."

      "content": "Indra and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe! Send downward, O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom. Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them away from us, pierce the voracious fiends.\n\nLet sin, Indra and Soma! round the wicked boil, like as a cald- ron set amid the flames of fire. Against the foe of prayer, eater of gory flesh, the fearful-eyed Kimidin, keep perpetual hate.\n\nIndra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them into darkness that hath no support, So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your wrathful might prevail and conquer them.\n\nIndra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth. Yea, fashion from the big clouds your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to death the waxing demon race.\n\nIndra and Soma, cast ye downward from the sky your deadly bolts of stone burning with fiery flame, Eternal, scorching darts. Plunge the voracious fiends within the depth, and let them pass without a sound.\n\nIndra and Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the girth encompasses two vigorous steeds The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you. Do ye, as Lords of men, animate these my prayers.\n\nIn your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy those evil spirits, kill the treacherous fiends. Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss whoso at any time- attacks and injures us.\n\nWhoso accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my way with guileless spirit, May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra! like water which the hollowed hand compresses.\n\nThose who destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their evil natures harm the righteous, May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of Nirriti consign them.\n\nO Agni, whosoever seeks to injure the essence of our food, kine, steeds, or bodies, May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction,. both himself and offspring.\n\nMay he be swept away, himself and children; may all the three earths press him down beneath them. May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or night would fain destroy us.\n\nThe prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other. Of these two that which is the true and honest Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing.\n\nNever doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title. He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entan- gled in the noose of Indra.\n\nAs if I worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts about the Gods, O Agni! Why art thou angry with us, Jātavedas? Destruction fall on those who lie against thee!\n\nSo may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life, or if I be a demon. Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue hath called me Yātudhāna.\n\nMay Indra slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of all creatures perish, The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon though devoid of demon nature.\n\nShe too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body in her guile and malice, May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones with loud ring destroy the demons.\n\nSpread out, ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and grind the Rākshasas to pieces, Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, and sully and pollute our holy worship.\n\nHurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it, Maghavan, made keen by Soma. Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the demons with thy rocky weapon.\n\nThey fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they harm indomitable Indra. Sakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now let him cast his bolt at fiendish wizards.\n\nIndra hath ever been the fiends' destroyer who spoil oblations of the Gods' invokers. Yea, Sakra, like an axe that splits the timber, assails and sma- shes them like earthen vessels.\n\nDestroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in. the form of dog or cuckoo. Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture: as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon.\n\nLet not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn. drive off the couples of Kimidins. Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble! From grief that comes from heaven Mid-air preserve us!\n\nIndra destroy the demon, male and female, joying and triumph- ing in arts of magic! Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no. more the Sun when he arises.\n\nLook, each one, hither, look around. Indra and Soma, watch ye well. Cast forth your weapon at the fiends: against the sorcerers hurl your bolt."

May that great shield on all sides guard my body, that to full old my life may be extended.\n\nLet the Gods' Charm be bound on me to keep me safe from every ill. Come ye and enter all within this pillar, the safe-guard of the body, thrice-defended.\n\nIn this let Indra lay a store of valour: approach ye Gods, and enter it together, For his long life, to last a hundred autumns, that to full age his days may be extended.\n\nLord of the clan who brings, us bliss, fiend-slayer, queller of the foe, May he, the conqueror, ne'er subdued, may Indra bind the Charm on thee, Bull, Soma-drinker, he who gives us peace.

Expelled by Plants, let men's and kine's Consumption pass from us to the navigable rivers.\n\nEmancipated from the sway of Agni, of Vaisvānara, go, covering the earth, ye Plants whose ruler is Vanaspati.\n\nMay these be pleasant to our heart, auspicious, rich in store of milk, These Plants of the Angirases which grow on mountains and on plains.\n\nThe Plants I know myself, the plants that with mine eye I look upon, Plants yet unknown, and those we know, wherein we find that power is stored,\n\nLet all the congregated Plants attend and mark mine utterance, That we may rescue this man here and save him from severe distress.\n\nAsvattha, Darbha, King of Plants, is Soma, deathless sacrifice Barley and Rice are healing balms, the sons of Heaven who never die.\n\nLift yourselves up, ye Healing Plants, loud is the thunder's crash and roar. When with full flow Parjanya, ye Children of Prisni! blesseth; you.\n\nWe give the essence of that stream of nectar of this man to drink: So I prepare a remedy that he may live a hundred years.\n\nWell doth the wild boar know a Plant, the mungoose knows the Healing Herb. I call, to aid this man, the Plants which Serpents and Gandhar- vas know.\n\nPlants of Angirases which hawks, celestial Plants which eagles. know; Plants known to swans and lesser fowl, Plants known to all the birds that fly. Plants that are known to sylvan beasts,—I call them all to aid this man.\n\nThe multitude of herbs whereon the Cows whom none may slaughter feed, all that are food for goats and sheep, So many Plants, brought hitherward, give shelter and defence to thee!\n\nHitherward unto thee I bring the Plants that cure all maladies, All Plants wherein physicians have discovered health-bestowing power.\n\nLet Plants with flower and Plants with bud, the fruitful and the fruitless, all, Like children of one mother, yield their stores for this man's perfeet health.\n\nFrom the Five-arrowed, from the Ten-arrowed have I delivered thee, Freed thee from Yama's fetter and from all offence against the Gods,"

Like reeds let them be broken through, down-smitten by a lifted rush.\n\nLet Parushāhva make them reeds, and let the bulrush strike them down: Bound in a mighty net let them break quickly like an arrow's shaft.\n\nAir was the net; the poles thereof were the great quarters of the sky: Sakra therewith enveloped and cast on the ground the Dasyus' host.\n\nVerily mighty is the net of mighty Sakra rich in wealth: Therewith press all the foemen down so that not one of them escape!\n\nGreat is thy net, brave Indra, thine the mighty match for a thousand, Lord of Hundred Powers! Holding them, with his host, therewith hath Indra slaughtered Dasyus a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.\n\nThis world so mighty was the net of Sakra, of the Mighty One: With this, the net of Indra, I envelop all those men with gloom.\n\nGreat weakness and misfortune, pain which words can never charm away, Languor, fatigue, bewilderment, with these I compass all the foes.\n\nI give those foemen up to Death: bound in the bonds of Death are they. I bind and carry them away to meet Death's wicked messengers.\n\nBear them away, Death's messengers! envoys of Yama! bind them fast. More than a thousand be their slain: the club of Bhava pierce them through!\n\nForth go the Sādhyas in their might bearing one netpole raised aloft. One pole the Rudras carry, one the Vasus, and the Ādityas one.\n\nThe Visve Devas from above shall come depressing it with might, And in the midst the Angirases, slaying the mighty host, shall go.\n\nTrees of the forest, trees that bear flower and fruit, and herbs and plants, Quadruped, biped send I forth that they may strike this army dead,\n\nGandharvas, and Apsarases, Gods, Serpents, Fathers, Holy Men, Seen and unseen, I send them forth that they may strike this army dead.\n\nHere spread are snares of Death wherefrom thou, once within them, ne'er art freed: Full many a thousand of the host yonder this horn shall smite and slay.\n\nThe Gharma hath been warmed with fire: this Homa slays a thousand men. Let Bhava, Prisnibāhu, and Sarva destroy that armament.\n\nTheir portion be the fire of Death, hunger, exhaustion, slaughter, fear. With your entangling snares and nets, Sarva and Indra! slay that host.\n\nFly, conquered, in alarm, ye foes, run driven by the spell away! Let not one man escape of those when routed by Brihaspati.\n\nDown fall their weapons on the ground: no strength be theirs to point a shaft: Then in their dreadful terror let their arrows wound their vital parts.\n\nLet Heaven and Earth roar out in wrath against them, and Air with all the Deities in concert, Let them not find a surety or a refuge, but torn away go down to Death together.\n\nThe mules of the Gods' car are heaven's four quarters; their hooves are sacred cakes, the air its body. Its sides are Heaven and Earth, its reins the Seasons, Voice is its hood, its grooms are sky's mid-regions.\n\nYear is the car, Full Year the seat for driving, Virāj the pole, the chariot's front is Agni, Indra the warrior, and the Moon the driver.\n\nHence conquer, conquer, Hail! be thou the victor! Let these be conquerors and those be conquered. Good luck to these, ill luck to those men yonder! With the dark-blue-and-red our foes I cover."

      "content": "Whence were these two produced? which was that region?' From what world, from which earth had they their being? Calves of Virāj, these two arose from water. I ask thee of these twain, who was their milker.\n\nHe who prepared a threefold home, and lying there made the water bellow through his greatness, Calf of Virāj, giving each wish fulfilment, made bodies for him- self far off, in secret.\n\nWhich are the three, the mighty three, whereof the fourth divides the voice, This may the Brāhman know by prayer and fervour, whereto belongs the one, whereto the other.\n\nOut of the Brihat as the sixth five Salmons have been fashioned forth: From Brihatī was Brihat formed: whence was the Brihatī com- posed?\n\nOn measure Brihatī is based, and measure on the measurer: From magic might came magic might, from magic might came Mātali.\n\nVaisvānara's image is the sky above us, so far as Agni forced both spheres asunder. Thence from that region as the sixth come praise-songs, and every sixth day hence again go upward.\n\nWe, Kagyapa! six present Rishis, ask thee—for thou hast prov- ed things tried and meet for trial They call Virāj the Father of Devotion: tell her to us thy friends in all her figures.\n\nShe whom, advancing, sacrifices follow, and when she takes her station stand beside her, By whose control and hest the spirit moveth, she is Virāj, in highest heaven, O Rishis.\n\nBreathless, she moves by breath of living creatures, Svarāj pre- cedes, Virāj comes closely after. Some men behold her not, and some behold her, Virāj meet- shaped, who thinks of all existence.\n\nWho hath perceived Virāj's duplication, perceived her seasons and her rule and practice? Who knows her steps, how oft, how far extended, who knows her home and number of her dawnings?\n\nShe here who first of all sent forth her lustre moves onward resting on these lower creatures. Exalted power and might are stored within her: the woman hath prevailed, the new-come mother.\n\nBoth Dawns on wings of song, with rich adornment, move on together to their common dwelling. Sūrya's two wives, unwasting, most prolific, knowing their way, move, rich in light, together.\n\nThe three have passed along the path of Order—three warm libations have regarded offspring One quickens progeny, one strengthens vigour, and one protects the kingdom of the pious.\n\nShe who was fourth was made by Agni, Soma, and Rishis as. they formed both halves of worship, Gāyatrī, Trishtup, Jagatī, Anushtup, Brihadarki lightening the sacrificer.\n\nFive milkings answer to the fivefold dawning, five seasons to the cow who bears five titles. The five sky-regions made fifteen in number, one head have these to one sole world directed.\n\nSix Elements arose, first-born of Order: the six-day time is carried by six Sāmans. Six-yoked the plough is, as each trace is numbered: they call both broad ones six; six, Earth and Heaven.\n\nThey call the cold months six, and six the hot ones. Which, tell us, of the seasons is redundant? Seven sages, eagles, have sat down together: seven metres match the seven Consecrations.\n\nSeven are the Homas, seven the logs for burning, seven are the streams of mead, and seven the seasons. Into the world have come seven streams of butter; those we have heard of as the Seven Vultures.\n\nSeven metres, by four syllables increasing, each of the seven founded upon another How are the hymns of praise on these supported, and how are these imposed upon the praise-songs?\n\nHow hath the Gāyatri filled out three triads? On the fifteen how is the Trishtup moulded, Jagatī fashioned on the three-and-thirty? How is Anushtup formed? how Ekavinsa?\n\nEight Elements sprang up, first born of Order: the Priests divine are eight in number, Indra! Eight are the wombs of Aditi, eight her children; for the eighth night is the libation destined.\n\nSo planning bliss for you have I come hither to win your friendship: kind am I, and gracious. Born from one source, propitious is your wisdom: knowing full well to all of you it cometh.\n\nTo Indra eight, to Yama six, seven to the Rishis, seven to each: The number five accompanies waters and men and healing herbs.\n\nThe Heifer, all his own, poured forth for Indra control and milk at her first time of milking; And he then satisfied the four divisions, the Gods and men and Asuras and Rishis.\n\nWho is the Cow? Who is the Single Rishi? What is the law, what are the benedictions? What on the earth is the one only Spirit? Which of the number is the Single Season?\n\nOne is the Cow, one is the Single Spirit, one is the law, single are benedictions. The Spirit dwelling on the earth is single: the Single Season never is transcended."

      "content": "Viraj at first was This. At birth all feared her; the thought, She will become this All, struck terror.\n\nShe rose, the Gārhapatya fire she entered. He who knows this becomes lord of a household, performer of domestic sacri- fices.\n\nShe mounted up, the Eastward fire she entered. He who knows this becomes the Gods' beloved, and to his call they come when she invokes them.\n\nShe mounted up, the Southward fire she entered. He who knows this becomes a fit performer of sacrifice, meet for honour, shelter-giver.\n\nShe mounted up, she entered the Assembly. He who knows this becomes polite and courtly, and people come as guests to his assembly.\n\nShe mounted up, she passed within the meeting. He who knows this becomes fit for the meeting, and to his hall of meeting come the people.\n\nShe mounted up, she entered Consultation. Whoso knows this is fit to be consulted, and to his consultation come the people.\n\nShe mounted up, and, into four divided, she took her station in the air's mid-region.\n\nOf her the Gods and men said, This she knoweth. That we may both have life let us invoke her.\n\nThus did they cry to her:\n\nCome, Strength! come, Food! come, Charmer! come, Free- giver!\n\nHer calf, her well-beloved calf, was Indra: Gāyatri was her rope, the cloud her udder.\n\nTwo teats she had, Rathantara and Brihat, two, Yajnāyajniya and Vāmadevya.\n\nWith the Rathantara the Gods milked from her the Plants, and all the wide expanse with Brihat.\n\nThey drew the Waters forth with Vāmadevya, with Yajnayaj- niya they milked out worship.\n\nFor him who knoweth this, Rathantara poureth out Plants, and Brihat yieldeth wide expansion.\n\nWaters from Vāmdevya come, from Yajnāyajniya sacrifice.\n\nShe rose, she came unto the tress: they killed her. A year went by and she again existed. Hence in a year the wounds of trees heal over. He who knows this sees his loathed rival wounded.\n\nShe mounted up, she came unto the Fathers: they killed her: in a month she re-existed. Hence men give monthly offerings to the Fathers: who knows this, knows the path which they have trodden.\n\nShe rose, she came unto the Gods: they killed her: but in a fortnight she again was living. Fortnightly, hence, men serve the Gods with Vasat! Who knows this knows the way which Gods pass over.\n\nShe mounted up, she came to men: they killed her Presently she regained her life and being. Hence on both days to men they bring and offer—who knows this—near-seated in the dwelling.\n\nShe rose, approached the Asuras: they called her: their cry was, Come, O Māyā, come thou hither. Her dear calf was Virochana Prāhrādi: her milking vessel was a. pan of iron. Dvimūrdhā Ārtvya milked her, yea, this Māyā, The Asuras depend for life on Māyā. He who knows this becomes a fit supporter.\n\nShe mounted up, she came unto the Fathers. The Fathers called. to her, O Food, come hither. King Yama was her calf, her pail was silvern. Antaka, Mrityu's. son, milked her, this Svadhā. This Food the Fathers make their lives' sustainer. He who• knows this becomes a meet supporter.\n\nShe mounted up, she came to men. They called her, Come unto- us, come hither thou Free-giver! Earth was her milking-pail, the calf beside her Manu Vaivasvata, Vivasvān's offspring. Prithi the son of Vena was her milker: he milked forth hus- bandry and grain for sowing. These men depend for life on corn and tillage. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, successful in the culture of his_ corn-land.\n\nShe rose, she came unto the Seven Rishis. They called her,. Come, Rich in Devotion! hither. King Soma was her calf. the Moon her milk-pail. Brihaspati. Āngirasa, her milker, Drew from her udder Prayer and Holy Fervour. Fervour and Prayer maintain the Seven Rishis. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, a priest illustri- ous for his sacred knowledge.\n\nShe rose, she came unto the Gods. They called her, crying, O Vigour, come to us, come hither! God Savitar milked her, he milked forth Vigour. The Gods depend for life upon that Vigour. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter.\n\nShe rose approached the Apsarases and Gandharvas. They called her, Come to us, O Fragrant-scented! The son of Sūryavarchas, Chitraratha, was her dear calf, her pail. a lotus-petal. The son of Sūryavarchas, Vasuruchi, milked and drew from her most delightful fragrance. That scent supports Apsarases and Gandharvas. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, and round him ever breathes delicious odour.\n\nShe mounted up, she came to Other People. They called her, crying, Come, Concealment! hither. Her dear calf was Vaisravana Kubera, a vessel never tempered was her milk-pail. Rajatanābhi, offspring of Kubera, milked her, and from her udder drew concealment. By that concealment live the Other People. He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, and makes all evil disappear and vanish.\n\nShe mounted up, she came unto the Serpents. The Serpents called her, Venomous! come hither. Her calf was Takshaka, Visāla's offspring: a bottlegourd suppli- ed a milking-vessel. Irāvān's offspring, Dhritarāshtra milked her, and from her udder drew forth only poison. That poison quickens and supports the Serpents: He who knows this becomes a meet supporter.\n\nOne would ward off, for him who hath this knowledge, if with a bottle-gourd he sprinkled water.\n\nAnd did he not repel, if in his spirit he said, I drive thee back, he would repel it.\n\nThe poison that it drives away, that poison verily repels.\n\nThe man who hath this knowledge pours its venom on his hated foe."
