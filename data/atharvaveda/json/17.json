      "content": "Vanquishing, overpowering, a conqueror, exceeding strong, Victorious, winner of the light, winner of cattle and of spoil,. Indra by name, adorable, I call: a long, long life be mine!\n\nVanquishing etc. Indra by name, adorable I call: May I be dear to Gods.\n\nVanquishing, etc. Indra by name, adorable, I call: may creatures love me well.\n\nVanquishing, etc. Indra by name, adorable, I call: may cattle hold me dear.\n\nVanquishing, etc. Indra by name, adorable, I call: may equals love me well.\n\nRise up, O Sūrya, rise thou up; with strength and splendour rise on me. Let him who hates me be my thrall; let me not be a thrall to him. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu. Sate us with cattle of all forms and colours: set me in happiness, in loftiest heaven.\n\nRise up, O Sūrya, rise thou up; with strength and splendour rise on me. Make me the favourite of all, of those I see and do not see. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nLet not the fowlers who are standing ready injure thee in the flood, within the waters. Ascend this heaven, leaving each curse behind thee, Favour us: let thy gracious love attend us. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nDo thou, O Indra, for our great good fortune, with thine in- violable rays protect us. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nBe thou most gracious unto us, Indra, with favourable aid, Rising to heaven's third sphere, invoked with song to quaff the Soma juice, loving thy home to make us blest. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nThou art the vanquisher of all, O Indra, omniscient Indra, and invoked of many. Indra, send forth this hymn that fitly lauds thee. Favour us let thy gracious love attend us. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nIn heaven and on the earth thou art uninjured, none reach thy greatness in the air's mid region. Increasing by inviolate devotion as such in heaven grant us pro- tection, Indra. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nGrant us protection, Indra, with that body of thine that is on earth, in fire, in waters, That dwells within light-finding Pavamana, wherewith thou hast pervaded air's mid region. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nIndra, exalting thee with prayer, imploring, Rishis have sat them down in holy Session. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu,\n\nRound Trita, round the spring with thousand currents thou goest, round the light-finding assembly. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nThou guardest well the four celestial regions, pervading heaven, and earth with light and splendour. Thou givest help to all these living creatures, and, knowing,. followest the path of Order. Manifold are thy great deed, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nWith five thou sendest heat: with one removing the curse thou comest in bright sunshine hither. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nIndra art thou, Mahendra thou, thou art the world, the Lord of Life. To thee is sacrifice performed: worshippers offer gifts to thee. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.\n\nWhat is based on what is not: the present lies on that which is.. Present on future is imposed and future on the present based. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu. Sate us with cattle of all varied colour. Set me in happiness, in loftiest heaven.\n\nBright art thou, and refulgent: as thou shinest with splendour so I fain would shine with splendour.\n\nLustre art thou, illuming: as thou glowest with lustre so I too would shine with cattle, with all the lustre of a Brāhman's station.\n\nGlory to him when rising, when ascending! Glory to him when he hath reached the zenith! To him far-shining, him the self-refulgent, to him the Sovran Lord and King be glory!\n\nWorship to him when he is turning westward, to him when set- ting, and when set be worship! To him far-shining, him the self-refulgent, to him the Sovran Lord and King be glory!\n\nWith all his fiery fervour this Āditya hath gone up on high, Giving my foes into my hand. Let me not by my foeman's prey. Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu. Sate us with cattle of all varied colours. Set me in happiness, in loftiest heaven.\n\nThou for our weal, Āditya, hast mounted thy ship with hundred oars. Thou hast transported me to day: so bear me evermore to night.\n\nThou for our weal, O Sūrya, hast mounted thy ship with hundred oars. Thou hast transported me to night: so bear me evermore to day.\n\nEncompassed by Prajāpati's devotion as shield, with Kasyapa's bright light and splendour, Reaching old age, may I made strong and mighty live through a thousand years with happy fortune.\n\nCompassed am I with prayer, my shield and armour; compassed with Kasyapa's bright light and splendour. Let not shafts reach me shot from heaven against me, nor those sent forth by men for my destruction.\n\nGuarded am I by Order and the Seasons, protected by the past and by the future. Let not distress, yea, let not Death come nigh me: with water of my speech have I o'erwhelmed them.\n\nOn every side let Agni guard and keep me; the rising Sun drive off the snares of Mrityu! Let brightly flushing Mornings, firm-set mountains, and lives a thousand be with me united."
