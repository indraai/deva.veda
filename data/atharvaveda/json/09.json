      "content": "The Asvins' Honey-whip was born from heaven and earth, from middle air, and ocean, and from fire and wind. All living creatures welcome it with joyful hearts, fraught with the store of Amrit it hath gathered up.\n\nThey call thee earth's great strength in every form, they call thee too the ocean's genial seed. Whence comes the Honey-whip bestowing bounty, there Vital Spirit is, and Amrit treasured.\n\nIn sundry spots, repeatedly reflecting, men view upon the earth: her course and action; For she, the first-born daughter of the Maruts, derives her origin from Wind and Agni.\n\nDaughter of Vasus, mother of Ādityas, centre of Amrit breath of living creatures. The Honey-whip, gold-coloured, dropping fatness, moves as a mighty embryo 'mid mortals.\n\nThe deities begat the Whip of Honey: her embryo assumed all forms and fashions. The mother nourishes that tender infant which at its birth looks on all worlds and beings.\n\nWho understandeth well, who hath perceived it, her heart's un- injured Soma-holding beaker? Let the wise Brāhman priest therein be joyful.\n\nHe understandeth them, he hath perceived them, her breasts that pour a thousand streams, uninjured. They unreluctantly yield strength and vigour.\n\nShe who with voice upraised in constant clamour, mighty, life- giving, goes unto her function, Bellowing to the heated three libations, suckles with streams of milk, and still is lowing.\n\nOn whom, well-fed, the Waters wait in worship, and steers and self-refulgent bulls attend her. For thee, for one like thee down pour the Waters, and cause desire and strength to rain upon thee.\n\nThe thunder is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou castest on the earth thy vigour. The Honey-whip, the Manus' first-born daughter, derives her origin from Wind and Agni.\n\nAs at the morning sacrifice the Asvins twain love Soma well, Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within my soul.\n\nAs at the second sacrifice Indra and Agni love him well, Let the pair, Indra Agni, lay splendour and strength within my soul.\n\nAs at third sacrifice Soma is the Ribhus' well-beloved one, Even so may they, the Ribhus, store splendour and strength within my soul.\n\nFain would I bring forth sweetness, fain would make it mine. Bringing milk, Agni! have I come: splendour and strength bestow on me!\n\nGrant me, O Agni, splendid strength, and progeny, and length- ened life. May the Gods know me as I am, may Indra with the Rishis know.\n\nAs honey-bees collect and add fresh honey to their honey store, Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within my soul.\n\nAs over honey flies besmear this honey which the bees have made, So may both Asvins lay in me splendour and strength and power and might.\n\nMay all the sweetness that is found in hills and mountains, steeds and kine, And wine that floweth from the cup,—may all that sweetness be in me.\n\nMay both the Asvins, Lords of Light, balm me with honey of the bees, That I may speak among the folk words full of splendour and of strength.\n\nThe thunder is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou castest strength on earth and heaven. To that all cattle look for their existence: with this she nourishes their force and vigour.\n\nThe Whip itself is Heaven, Earth is the handle, the point of juncture is the Air's mid-region. The lash is lightning, and the tip is golden.\n\nWhoever knows the Whip's seven kinds of honey, becomes himself a man endowed with sweetness. Brāhman and King, the draught-ox and the milch-cow, barley and rice, and honey is the seventh.\n\nSweet is the man, sweet are his goods and chattels: he who knows this conquers the worlds of sweetness.\n\nThe thundering of Prajāpati in heaven is verily manifest to living creatures. Therefore I stand from right to left invested, and, O Prajāpati, I cry, regard me! The man who hath this knowledge is regarded by living beings and the Lord of Creatures."

Beneath my feet cast down mine adversaries with thy great manly power, when I have praised thee.\n\nThat which is hateful to mine eye and spirit, that harasses and robs me of enjoyment, The evil dream I loose upon my foemen. May I rend him when I have lauded Kāma.\n\nKāma, do thou, a mighty Lord and Ruler, let loose ill dream, misfortune, want of children, Homelessness, Kāma! utter destitution, upon the sinner who designs my ruin.\n\nDrive them away, drive them afar, O Kāma; indigence fall on those who are my foemen! When they have been cast down to deepest darkness, consume their dwellings with thy fire, O Agni.\n\nShe, Kāma! she is called the Cow, thy daughter, she who is named Vāk and Virāj by sages. By her drive thou my foemen to a distance. May cattle, vital breath, and life forsake them.\n\nBy Kāma's might, King Varuna's and Indra's, by Vishnu's strength, and Savitar's instigation, I chase my foes with sacrifice to Agni, as a deft steersman drives his boat through waters.\n\nMay Kāma, mighty one, my potent warder, give me full free- dom from mine adversaries. May all the Deities be my protection, all Gods come nigh to this mine invocation.\n\nAccepting this oblation rich with fatness, be joyful here, ye Gods whose chief is Kāma, Giving me freedom from mine adversaries.\n\nYe, Indra, Agni, Kāma! come together and cast mine adver- saries down beneath me. When they have sunk into the deepest darkness, O Agni, with thy fire consume their dwellings.\n\nSlay those who are mine enemies, O Kāma: headlong to depth of blinding darkness hurl them. Reft be they all of manly strength and vigour! Let them not have a single day's existence.\n\nKāma hath slain those who were mine opponents, and given me ample room to grow and prosper. Let the four regions bow them down before me, and let the six expanses bring me fatness.\n\nLet them drift downward like a boat torn from the rope that held it fast. There is no turning back for those whom our keen arrows have repelled.\n\nAgni averts, Indra averts, and Soma: may the averting Gods avert this foeman.\n\nTo be avoided by his friends, detested, repelled, with few men round him, let him wander. Yea, on the earth descend the lightning-flashes: may the strong God destroy your adversaries.\n\nThis potent lightning nourishes things shaken, and things un- shaken yet, and all the thunders. May the Sun, rising with his wealth and splendour, drive in victorious might my foemen downward.\n\nThy firm and triply-barred protection, Kāma! thy spell, made weapon-proof extended armour With that drive thou my foemen to a distance. May cattle, vital breath, and life forsake them.\n\nFar from the world wherein we live, O Kāma, drive thou my foemen with that selfsame weapon Wherewith the Gods repelled the fiends, and Indra cast down the Dasyus into deepest darkness.\n\nAs Gods repelled the Asuras, and Indra down to the lowest darkness drove the demons, So, Kāma, from this world, to distant places, drive thou the men who are mine adversaries.\n\nFirst before all sprang Kāma into being. Gods, Fathers, mortal men have never matched him. Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee, to thee I offer worship.\n\nWide as the space which heaven and earth encompass, far as the flow of waters, far as Agni, Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee, to thee I offer worship.\n\nVast as the quarters of the sky and regions that lie between them spread in all directions, vast as celestial tracts and views of heaven, Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee, to thee I offer worship.\n\nMany as are the bees, and bats, and reptiles, and female serpents of the trees, and beetles, Stronger art thou than these, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee, to thee I offer worship.\n\nStronger art thou than aught that stands or twinkles, stronger art thou than ocean, Kāma! Manyu! Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee, to thee I offer worship. \n\nNot even Vāta is the peer of Kāma, not Agni, Chandramas the Moon, nor Sūrya. Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee, to thee I offer worship.\n\nThy lovely and auspicious forms, O Kāma, whereby the thing thou wilt becometh real, With these come thou and make thy home among us, and make malignant thoughts inhabit elsewhere."

I come to thee, innocent, turned to welcome me: For Fire and Water are within, the first chief door of sacrifice.\n\nWater that kills Consumption, free from all Consumption, here I bring. With Agni, the immortal one, I enter and possess the house.\n\nLay thou no cord or noose on us: a weighty burthen, still be light! Withersoever be our will, O House, we bear thee like a bride.\n\nNow from the east side of the house to the Great Power be homage paid!

May Agni Jātavedas bear him offered, on pathways traversed by the Gods, to Indra.\n\nThe husband of the cows, the young calves' father, father is he of mighty water-eddies. Calf, after-birth, new milk drawn hot, and biestings, curds, butter, that is his best genial humour.\n\nHe is the Gods' allotted share and bundle, essence of waters, and of plants, and butter. Sakra elected him, the draught of Soma. What was his body was a lofty mountain.\n\n6. A beaker filled with Soma juice thou bearest. framer of forms, begetter of the cattle. Kindly to us be these thy wombs here present, and stay for us, O Axe, those that are yonder.\n\nHe bears oblation, and his seed is butter. Thousand-fold plenty; sacrifice they call him. May he, the Bull, wearing the shape of Indra, come unto us, O Gods, bestowed, with blessing.\n\nBoth arms of Varuna, and Indra's vigour, the Maruts' hump is he, the Asvins' shoulders. They who are sages, bards endowed with wisdom, call him Brihaspati compact and heightened.\n\nThou, vigorous, reachest to the tribes of heaven. Thee they call Indra, thee they call Sarasvān. Turned to one aim, that Brāhman gives a thousand who offers up the Bull as his oblation.\n\nBrihaspati, Savitar gave thee vital vigour: thy breath was brought from Tvashtar and from Vāyu. In thought I offer thee in air's mid-region. Thy sacrificial grass be Earth and Heaven!\n\nLet the priest joyfully extol the limbs and members of the Bull Who moved and roared among the kine as Indra moves among the Gods.\n\nThe sides must be Anumati's, and both rib-pieces Bhaga's share, Of the knee-bones hath Mitra said, Both these are mine, and only mine.\n\nThe Ādityas claim the hinder parts, the loins must be Brihas- pati's. Vāta, the God, receives the tail: he stirs the plants and herbs therewith,\n\nTo Sūryā they assigned the skin, to Sinivāli inward parts. The Slaughterer hath the feet, they said, when they distributed the Bull.\n\nThey made a jest of kindred's curse: a jar of Soma juice was set, What time the deities, convened, assigned the Bull's divided parts.\n\nThey gave the hooves to tortoises, to Saramā scraps of the feet: His undigested food they gave to worms and things that creep and crawl.\n\nThat Bull, the husband of the kine, pierces the demons with his horns, Banishes famine with his eye, and hears good tidings with his ears.\n\nWith hundred sacrifices he worships: the fires consume him not: All Gods promote the Braman who offers the Bull in sacrifice.\n\nHe who hath given away the Bull to Brāhmans frees and cheers his soul. In his own cattle-pen he sees the growth and increase of his cows.\n\nLet there be cattle, let there be bodily strength and progeny: All this may the Gods kindly grant to him who gives away the Bull.\n\nIndra here verily hath rejoiced: let him bestow conspicuous wealth. May he draw forth at will from yonder side of heaven a deft cow, good to milk, whose calf is never wanting.\n\nWith close connexion mingle with the cows in this our cattle- pen: Mingle, the Bull's prolific flow, and, Indra! thine heroic strength!\n\nHere we restore this Bull, your youthful leader: sporting with him, go, wander at your pleasure. Ne'er, wealthy ones! may he be reft of offspring; and do ye favour us with growth of riches."

Crossing in many a place the mighty darkness, let the Goat mount to the third heaven above us.\n\nI bring thee hither as a share for Indra; prince, at this sacrifice,. for him who worships. Grasp firmly from behind all those who hate us: so let the sacri- ficer's men be sinless.\n\nWash from his feet all trace of evil-doing: foreknowing, with cleansed hooves let him go upward. Gazing on many a spot, crossing the darkness, let the Goat mount to the third heaven above us.\n\nCut up this skin with the grey knife, Dissector! dividing joint from joint, and mangle nothing Do him no injury: limb by limb arrange him, and send him up to the third cope of heaven.\n\nWith verse upon the fire I set the caldron: pour in the water; lay him down within it! Encompass him with fire, ye Immolators. Cooked, let him reach the world where dwell the righteous.\n\nHence come thou forth, vexed by no pain or torment. Mount to the third heaven from the heated vessel. As fire out of the fire hast thou arisen. Conquer and win this lucid world of splendour.\n\nThe Goat is Agni: light they call him, saying that living man must give him to the Brāhman. Given in this world by a devout believer, the Goat dispels and drives afar the darkness.\n\nLet the Panchaudana Goat, about to visit the three lights, pass away in five divisions. Go midst the pious who have paid their worship, and parted, dwell on the third cope of heaven.\n\nRise to that world, O Goat, where dwell the righteous: pass, like a Sarabha veiled, all difficult places.

Sacrifice, filled, filled full, offered with Vashat—this let the Gods arrange.at proper seasons.\n\nHome-woven raiment let him give, and gold as guerdon to the priests. So he obtains completely all celestial and terrestrial worlds.\n\nNear to thee, Goat! approach these streams of Soma, divine, distilling meath, bedecked with butter! Stay thou the earth and sky and fix them firmly up on the seven- rayed pitch and height of heaven.\n\nUnborn art thou, O Goat: to heaven thou goest. Though thee Angirases knew that radiant region. So may I know that holy world.\n\nConvey our sacrifice to heaven, that it may reach the Gods, with that Whereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands, and all pre- cious things.\n\nThe Goat Panchaudana, when cooked, transporteth, repelling Nirriti, to the world of Svarga. By him may we win worlds which Sūrya brightens.\n\nThe droppings of the Odanas attending the Goat which I have lodged with priest or people May all this know us in the world of virtue, O Agni, at the meeting of the pathways.\n\nThis Unborn cleft apart in the beginning: his breast became the earth, his back was heaven. His middle was the air, his sides the regions; the hollows of his belly formed both oceans.\n\nHis eyes were Truth and Right. The whole together was Truth: Virāj his head and Faith his breathing. This Goat Panchaudana was indeed a sacrifice unlimited.\n\nA boundless sacrifice he performs, he wins himself a boundless world: Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly fee.\n\nLet him not break the victim's bones, let him not suck the marrow out. Let the man, taking him entire, here, even here deposit him.\n\nThis, even this is his true form: the man uniteth him therewith. Food, greatness, strength he bringeth him who giveth the Goat Panchaudana illumed with guerdon.\n\nThe five gold pieces, and the five new garments, and the five milch-kine yield him all his wishes. Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly fee.\n\nThe five gold pieces, area light to light him, robes become armour to defend his body; He winneth Svarga as his home who giveth the Goat Panchaud- ana illumed with bountry.\n\nWhen she who hath been wedded finds a second husband after- ward, The twain shall not be parted if they give the Goat Panchaud- ana.\n\nOne world with the re-wedded wife becomes the second hus- band's home.

He who hath this know- ledge is the abiding-place of welfare, of progeny, and of cattle.\n\nFor him the rising Sun murmurs, and Early Morning sings the prelude; Noon chants the psalm, Afternoon joins in; the setting Sun takes up the conclusion.

He who hath this knowledge is the abiding- place of welfare, of progeny, and of cattle.\n\nHe looks at the guests, he utters a gentle sound; he speaks, he signs the prelude; he calls for water, he chants the psalm; he offers the residue of the sacrifice, he takes up the conclusion.\n\nWhen he summons the door-keeper he gives instruction.\n\nHe (the door-keeper) pronounces the sacrificial formula in his answer to what he hears.\n\nWhen the attendants with vessels in their hands, foremost and hindmost, come in, they are just the priests who manage the Soma cups.\n\nNot one of them is incompetent to sacrifice.\n\nOr if the host, having offered food to his guest, goes up to the house, he virtually enters the bath of purification.\n\nWhen he distributes food he distributes priestly fees; what he performs he asks as favour.\n\nHe having been invited on earth, regales, invited in that, which wears all various forms on earth.\n\nHe, having been invited in air, regales, invited, in that which wears all various forms in air.\n\nHe having been invited in the sky, regales, invited, in that which wears all various forms in the sky.\n\nHe, having been invited among the gods, regales, invited in that which wears all various forms among the Gods.\n\nHe, having been invited in the worlds, regales, invited, in that which wears all various forms in the worlds.\n\nHe, having been invited hath been invited.\n\nHe gains this world and the world yonder.\n\nHe who hath this knowledge wins the luminous spheres."

      "content": "The second brother of this lovely Hotar, hoary with eld, is the voracious Lightning. The third is he whose back is balmed with butter. Here have I seen the King with seven male children.\n\nThe seven make the one-wheeled chariot ready: bearing seven names the single Courser draws it. The wheel, three-naved, is sound and undecaying: thereon these worlds of life are all dependent.\n\nThe seven who on this seven-wheeled car are mounted have horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward. Seven sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the Cows' seven names are held and treasured.\n\nWho hath beheld at birth the Primal Being, when She who hath no bone supports the bony? Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may ap- proach the man who knows, to ask it?\n\nLet him who knoweth presently declare it, this lovely Bird's securely-founded station. Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and wearing his ves- ture with their foot have drunk the water.\n\nUnripe in mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods' established places. High up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their own seven threads have woven.\n\nHere, ignorant, I ask the wise who know it, as one who knows not, for the sake of knowledge, What is That One, who in the Unborn's image hath stablished and fixed firm this world's six regions.\n\nThe Mother gave the Sire his share of Order. With thought at first she wedded him in spirit. She, coyly loth, was filled with dew prolific. With adoration men approached to praise her.\n\nYoked was the Mother to the boon Cow's car-pole; in humid folds of cloud the infant rested. Then the Calf lowed and looked upon the Mother, the Cow who wears all shapes in three directions.\n\nBearing three mothers and three fathers, single he stood erect: they never made him weary. On yonder heaven's high ridge they speak together in speech not known to all, themselves all-knowing.\n\nUpon the five-spoked wheel revolving ever, whereon all crea- tures rest and are dependent, The axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient time remains unheated.\n\nThey call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed, of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store. These others, later still, say that he takes his stand upon a seven- wheeled car, six-spoked, whose sight is clear.\n\nFormed with twelve spokes, too strong for age to weaken, this wheel of during Order rolls round heaven. Herein established, joined in pairs together, seven hundred sons and twenty stand, O Agni.\n\nThe wheel revolves, unwasting, with its felly: ten draw it, yoked to the far-stretching car-pole. Girt by the region moves the eye of Sūrya, on whom dependent rest all living creatures.\n\nThey told me these were males, though truly females. He who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not. The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father's father.\n\nOf the co-born they call the seventh single-born: the six twin, pairs are called the Rishis, sons of Gods. Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and, various, form by form, move for their guiding Lord.\n\nBeneath the upper realm, above this lower, bearing her Calf at foot, the Cow hath risen. Whitherward, to what place hath she departed? Where doth she calve? Not in this herd of cattle.\n\nWho, that the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper realm, above the lower, Showing himself a sage, may here declare him? Whence hath the godlike spirit had its rising?\n\nThose that come hitherward they call departing, those that depart they call directed hither. Whatever ye have made, Indra and Soma! steeds draw, as' twere, yoked to the region's car-pole.\n\nTwo Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the same sheltering tree have found a refuge, One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's berry: the other, eat- ing not, regardeth only.\n\nThe tree whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they all rest and procreate their offspring Upon the top, they say the fruit is luscious: none gaineth it who knoweth not the Father.\n\nWhere the fine birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eter- nal, and the sacred synods. There is the Universe's Guard and Keeper who, wise hath entered into me the simple."

Gāyatri hath, they say, three logs for burning: hence it excels in majesty and vigour.\n\nI invocate this Milch-cow good at milking, so that the Milker, deft of hand, may milk her. May \"Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron is made hot: he will proclaim it.\n\nShe, Lady of all treasures, hath come hither, yearning in spirit for her calf, and lowing. May this Cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she prosper to our high advantage.\n\nThe Cow hath lowed after her blinking youngling: she licks his forehead as she lows, to form it. His mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him with milk while gently lowing.\n\nHe also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow lows as she closely clings to him who sheds the rain. She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal men, and turn- ed to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.\n\nThat which hath breath and life and speed and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses. The living moves by powers of the departed: the immortal is the brother of the mortal.\n\nThe old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber, who runs his circling course with many round him. Behold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day is living.\n\nHe who hath made him doth not comprehend him: from him who saw him surely he is hidden. He, yet enveloped in his mother's bosom, source of much life, hath sunk into destruction.\n\nI saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by his pathways and departing. He clothed with gathered and diffusive splendours, within the worlds continually travels.\n\nDyaus is our father, our begetter: kinship is here. This great Earth is our kin and mother. Between the wide-spread world-halves is the birth-place. The Father laid the Daughter's germ within it.\n\nI bid thee tell me earth's extremest limit, about the Stallion's genial flow I ask thee; I ask about the universe's centre, and touching highest heaven where Speech abideth.\n\nThe earth's most distant limit is this altar: this Soma is the Stallion's genial humour; This sacrifice the universe's centre: this Brāhman highest heaven where Speech abideth.\n\nWhat thing I truly am I know not clearly: mysterious, fettered in my mind I wander. When the first-born of holy Law approached me, then of this Speech I first obtain a portion.\n\nBack, forward goes he, grasped by power inherent, immortal born the brother of the mortal. Ceaseless they move in opposite directions: men mark the one and fail to mark the other.\n\nSeven germs unripened yet are Heaven's prolific seed: their functions they maintain by Vishnu's ordinance. Endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought, present on every side they compass us about.\n\nUpon what syllable of holy praise-hymn, as 'twere their highest heaven, the Gods repose them Who knows not this, what will he do with praise-hymn? But they who know it well sit here assembled.\n\nThey, ordering the verse's foot by measure, with the half-verse arranged each thing that moveth. Prayer was diffused in many forms three-footed thereby the world's four regions have their being\n\nFortunate mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also be exceeding wealthy. Feed on the grass, O Cow, through all the seasons, and coming hitherward drink limpid water.\n\nForming the water-floods the Cow herself hath lowed, one-foot- ed or two-footed or four-footed, she, Who hath become eight-footed or acquired nine feet, the uni- verse's thousand-syllabled Pankti. From her descend in streams the seas of water.\n\nDark the descent: the birds are golden-coloured. Robed in the floods they fly aloft to heaven. Again from Order's seat have they descended, and inundated all the earth with fatness.\n\nThe footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh, Mitra Varuna! this your doing? The Babe unborn supporteth this world's burthen, supporteth Right and watcheth Wrong and Falsehood.\n\nVirāj is Speech, and Earth, and Air's mid-region. He is Praja- pati, and he is Mrityu. He is the Lord Imperial of the Sādhyas. He rules what is and what shall be hereafter. May he make me lord of what is and shall be.\n\n1 saw from far away the smoke of fuel with spires that rose on high o'er that beneath it. The heroes cooked and dressed the spotted bullock. These were the customs in the days aforetime.\n\nThree with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them sheareth when the year is ended. One with his powers the universe regardeth. Of one the sweep is seen, but not the figure.\n\nSpeech hath been measured out in four divisions: the Brāhmans who have wisdom comprehend them. Three, kept in close concealment, cause no motion. Of Speech men speak the fourth division only.\n\nThey call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni; and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutmān. That which is One bards call by many a title: they call It Agni, Yama, Mātariswan."
