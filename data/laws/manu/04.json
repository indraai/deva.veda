For in the next world neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor sons, nor relations stay to be his companions. Spiritual merit alone remains with him. Single is each being born; single it dies; single it enjoys the reward of its virtue; single it suffers the punishment of its sin. Leaving the dead body on the ground like a log of wood, or a clod of earth, the relatives depart with averted faces; but spiritual merit follows the soul. Let him therefore always slowly accumulate spiritual merit, in order that it may be his companion after death. For with merit as his companion he will traverse a gloom difficult to traverse. That companion speedily conducts the man who is devoted to duty and effaces his sins by austerities, to the next world, radiant and clothed with an ethereal body.",
