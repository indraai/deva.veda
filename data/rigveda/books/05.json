Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of heaven.\np: For worship of the Gods the Priest was wakened: at morning gracious Agni hath arisen. Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set free from darkness.\np: When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk pure Agni is anointed. The strength-bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front, with tongues, erect, he drinketh.\np: The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to Sūrya. He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at daybreak as a strong white charger.\np: The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the well-laid fuel. Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Priest most skilled in worship.\np: Agni hath sat him down, a Priest most skilful, on a sweet-smelling place, his Mother's bosom. Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o’er many, kindled among the folk whom he sustaineth.\np: This Singer excellent at sacrifices, Agni the Priest, they glorify with homage. Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong Steed who never faileth.\np: He, worshipful House-Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own auspicious guest, lauded by sages. That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni, thou excellest others.\np: Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast appeared most lovely, Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of the people.\np: To thee, Most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the people bring their tribute. Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high, auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter.\np: Ascend to-day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy Ones around it. Knowing the paths by mid-air's spacious region bring hither Gods to feast on our oblation.\np: To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song of praise and homage. Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far-reaching, like gold light to heaven.",

The Babe unborn increased through many autumns.

How can the Indraless, the hymnless harm me?\np: I saw him moving from the place he dwells in, even as with a herd, brilliantly shining. These seized him not: he had been born already. They who were grey with age again grow youthful.\np: Who separate my young bull from the cattle, they whose protector was in truth no stranger? Let those whose hands have seized upon them free them. May he, observant, drive the herd to us-ward.\np: Mid mortal men godless have secreted the King of all who live, home of the people. So may the prayers of Atri give him freedom. Reproached in turn be those who now reproach him.\np: Thou from the stake didst loose e’en Śunaḥśepa bound for a thousand; for he prayed with fervour. So, Agni, loose from us the bonds that bind us, when thou art seated here, O Priest who knowest.\np: Thou hast sped from me, Agni, in thine anger: this the protector of Gods’ Laws hath told me. Indra who knoweth bent his eye upon thee: by him instructed am I come, O Agni.\np: Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his greatness makes all things apparent. He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the Rakṣas.\np: Loud in the heaven above be Agni's roarings with keen-edged weapons to destroy the demons. Forth burst his splendours in the Soma's rapture. The godless bands press round but cannot stay him.\np: As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn for thee have fashioned. If thou, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the heavenly Waters.\np: May he, the strong-necked Steer, waxing in vigour, gather the foeman's wealth with none to check him. Thus to this Agni have the Immortals spoken. To man who spreads the grass may he grant shelter, grant shelter to the man who brings oblation.",

With these subdue for us the men who hate us.\np: They were not turned to us-wtrd, lofty Indra! while yet through lack of prayer they stood unharnessed. Ascend this chariot, thou whose hand wields thunder, and draw the rein, O Lord of noble horses.\np: Thou, because many lauds are thine, O Indra, wast active warring in the fields for cattle. For Sūrya in his own abode thou, Hero, formedst in fights even a Dāsa's nature.\np: Thine are we, Indra; thine are all these people, conscious of might, whose cars are set in motion.

Such, Lord of Treasure, give us splendid riches. I praise the Friend's gift, his whose wealth is mighty.\np: Thus favour us, O Indra, with ihy succour; Hero, protect the bards who sing thy praises. Be friendly in the fray to those who offer the skin of beautiful and well-pressed Soma.\np: And these ten steeds which Trasadasyu gives me, the goldrich chief, the son of Purukutsa, Resplendent in their brightness shall convey me. Gairiksita willed it and so came I hither.\np: And these, bestowed as sacrificial guerdon, the powerful tawny steeds of Marutasva; And thousands which kind Cyavatana gave me, abundantly bestowed for my adornment.\np: And these commended horses, bright and active, by Dhvanya son of Laksmana presented, Came unto me, as cows into the Ṛṣi Samvarana's stall, with magnitude of riches.",

Let us keep those who hate us at a distance, and haste to meet the man who sacrifices.\np: Come, let us carry out, O friends, the purpose wherewith the Mother threw the Cow's stall open, That wherewith Manu conquered Visisipra, wherewith the wandering merchant gained heaven's water.\np: Here, urged by hands, loudly hath rung the press-stone wherewith Navagvas through ten months sang praises. Saramā went aright and found the cattle. Aṅgiras gave effect to all their labours.\np: When at the dawning of this mighty Goddess, Aṅgirases all sang forth with the cattle,— Their spring is in the loftiest place of meeting,—Saramā found the kine by Order's pathway.\np: Borne by his Coursers Seven may Sūrya visit the field that spreadeth wide for his long journey. Down on the Soma swooped the rapid Falcon. Bright was the young Sage moving mid his cattle.\np: Sūrya hath mounted to the shining ocean when he hath yoked his fair-backed Tawny Horses. The wise have drawn him like a ship through water: the floods obedient have descended hither.\np: I lay upon the Floods your hymn, lightwinning, wherewith Navagvas their ten months completed. Through this our hymn may we have Gods to guard us: through this our hymn pass safe beyond affliction.",
